AFS is a distributed network filesystem originially developed as part of the [[AndrewProject]] at [[CarnegieMellonUniversity]] in the mid 1980's. It provides a number of useful features over traditional network filesystems, including:

- [[AccessControlLists]]
- [[UserManagedGroups]]
- [[KerberosAuthentication]]
- Transparent volume moves
- [[VolumeReplication]]

Today there are three major implementations of the AFS3 protocol:

- [[IBMAFS]]
- [[OpenAFS]]
- [[ArlaAFS]]

Elsewhere on this site are a guide to [[GettingStarted]] with AFS, some [[AncientHistory]], and a variety of AFS3 [[ProtocolInfo]].
