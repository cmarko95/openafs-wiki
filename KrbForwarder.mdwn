The OpenAFS client for windows expects the DB-servers to respond to kerberosrequests(\*), which is not the case if you run for ex. a MIT or heimdal KDC on separate mashines. The krb-forward utility is installed on the DB-servers and acts as a proxy to the real KDC's.

You can get it from my CVS-repo here. checkout the source like this (you need -R patch to your cvs):

cvs -R -d /afs/e.kth.se/src/SourceRepository co s3/krb-forward

the source builds on Linux, Digital UNIX and Solaris. The program was written by Love H�rnquist �strand

(\*) This is not true when MIT Kerberos for Windows <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/> is installed on the machine. In that case, the Kerberos libraries look for the MIT or Heimdal KDC independent of the CellServDB entries.
