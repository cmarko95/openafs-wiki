-- Steven Jenkins - 11 Jun 2007 [[VInitVolumePackage]] is the main setup program for the fileserver, salvageserver, and volserver (and some utilities). It initializes the data structures need by each to do their operations. Synchronization is done via `vol_glock_mutex`, `vol_trans_mutex`, `vol_put_volume_cond`, and `vol_sleep_cond`.

- Called by:

1. fileserver
2. salvageserver
3. volserver
4. vol-dump utility
5. salvager
6. vol-bless utility (unsupported)

- Does: (among other operations)

1. [[VInitPartitionPackage]]
2. [[VInitVolumeHash]]
3. [[VInitVnodes]] (for small &amp; large vnodes)
4. [[VAttachVolumesByPartition]]

[[VInitPartitionPackage]] simply allocates memory for use by the caller (for DAFs -- for non-DAFS, it's a no-op)

[[VInitVolumeHash]] allocates memory and sets up [[VolumeHashTable]].Table; also does queue\_Init for reach entry in the Table.

[[VInitVnodes]] allocates memory for the Vnode hash, and initializes all values in the entries (to 0 or NULL), or the nextpointer.

[[VInitVolumesByPartition]] reads the disk and calls [[VAttachVolumeByName]] ([[VPreAttachVolumeByName]] for DAFS) for each volume on the disk.
