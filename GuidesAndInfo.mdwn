## External guides and information ##

These are some links to various documents that exist online that describe
creating a new AFS cell. The most common problem with a lot of existing
documentation is that it has you install the kaserver, which is highly
deprecated. Any new cell installation really should install a conventional
kerberos server (MIT, Heimdal and the Windows Active Directory server all have
been used as kerberos servers for various AFS cells).

* [OpenAFS server tutorial for Debian Squeeze](http://openafs.dk/doku.php?id=server:start)
* The Gentoo [OpenAFS Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openafs.xml) From the
  Gentoo Linux distribution. Again, takes you through using kaserver, which is
  highly deprecated.
* [Using NetBSD to provide AFS and Kerberos
  services](http://kula.tproa.net/talks/afsbpw2005) Talk from the 2005 AFS &amp;
  Kerb Workshop, describing how to use [[NetBSD]] to provide AFS and Kerberos
  services. Some steps are [[NetBSD]] specific, but there are key bits of info in
  there on using a Heimdal KDC as your kerberos server.
