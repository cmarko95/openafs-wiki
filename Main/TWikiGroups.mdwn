These groups can be used to define fine grained [[TWikiAccessControl]] in %WIKITOOLNAME%:

- [[TWikiAdminGroup]]
- [[EngineeringGroup]]
- [[SupportGroup]]
-

Add your groups to this list and define new group topics similar to existing ones. Group topics **_must_** end in `...Group.`

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Think twice before restricting write access to a web or a topic, because an open system where everybody can contribute is the essence of the [[WikiCulture]]. Experience shows that unrestricted write access works very well because:

- There is enough peer pressure to post only appropriate content.
- Content does not get lost because topics are under revision control.
- A topic revision can be undone by a member of the [[TWikiAdminGroup]] in case needed.

**_Related topics:_** [[TWikiAccessControl]], [[WebPreferences]], [[TWikiUsers]], [[WikiCulture]].
