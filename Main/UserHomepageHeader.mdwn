# <a name="Header of User Homepages"></a> Header of User Homepages

**_Note:_** This is a maintenance topic, used by the TWiki administrator.

The part between the horizontal rules gets included at the top of every [[TWikiUsers]] homepage. The header can be customized to the needs of your organization. For example, show all frequently used fields from the [[UserForm]] on top, followed by a personalized portal. The portal can pull content from other places, such as headline news by department, a list of current projects, etc. The TWiki:TWiki.UserHomepageSupplement has some additional documentation and ideas on customizing the homepages.
