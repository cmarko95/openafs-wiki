Every AFS file server machine must have at least one partition or logical volume dedicated to storing AFS volumes. Each server partition is mounted at a directory named /vicepxx, where xx is one or two lowercase letters. The /vicepxx directories must reside in the file server machine's root directory, not in one of its subdirectories (for example, /usr/vicepa is not an acceptable directory location). For additional information, see Performing Platform-Specific Procedures.

1. Create a directory called /vicepxx for each AFS server partition you are configuring (there must be at least one). Repeat the command for each partition.

       # mkdir /vicepxx

1. Use the SAM program to create a file system on each partition. For instructions, consult the HP-UX documentation.

1. On some HP-UX systems that use logical volumes, the SAM program automatically mounts the partitions. If it has not, mount each partition by issuing either the mount -a command to mount all partitions at once or the mount command to mount each partition in turn.
