These are current suggested questions that will be sent to the [[OpenAFS]] community to see what users would like to see as part of the re-design. Please post other questions, or comments on these current suggested questions.

- What type of [[OpenAFS]] user so you consider yourself?
- How long have you been using [[OpenAFS]]?
- What sort of information do you wish you'd known when starting?
- What sort of information would you like to see on a future [[OpenAFS]] web site?
- What type of documentation already exists that could be centralized on the [[OpenAFS]] website?
- What type of documentation doesn't exist, but you would like to see? Would you be willing to provide it?
- Can you think of anything else that should be taken into account for the design/content/implementation of the [[OpenAFS]] website?
- Are you ok with leaving the current website almost as is, and targeting it at developers?
- Should we maintain a wiki? Or would you rather the information on the wiki be assimilated into the website, and do away with the wiki?
- What is important to you when viewing a website?
- The last three times you visited openafs.org, what questions were you trying to answer?
