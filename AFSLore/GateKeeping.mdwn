This page will have gatekeeping policy/information.

Commit any patches to the head with a delta name that describes what they are

Using ~shadow/pullup-15 (for openafs-devel-1\_5\_x branch) or ~shadow/pullup (for openafs-stable-1\_4\_x branch) scripts, pull your patches up to relevant branches. You will need to do the pullups, at least, on grand, or rework the scripts to access the delta files some other way.

if you need to hand edit or apply the patches for the branches, please use delta names on the branches which are the same **except** prefix with the branch name tag

e.g.

aix-fixes-20080101 becomes DEVEL15-aix-fixes-20080101 on openafs-devel-1\_5\_x and STABLE14-aix-fixes-20080101 on openafs-stable-1\_4\_x

if you look at /data/delta/OpenAFS-(branchname) on grand.central.org you can see what other branch prefix is used, for each branch. i promise to start keeping track of this in a file.
