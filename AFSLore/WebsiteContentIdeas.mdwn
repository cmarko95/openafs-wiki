Please post website content ideas here.

- Some users would like to see a centralized page that links to unofficial [[OpenAFS]] tools, or tools provided by entities outside of the [[OpenAFS]] project
- Another requested set of content is current updates from either meetings of the Gatekeepers, the Elders, or even just a report as to what has been going on recently.
  - It has been suggested that a project roadmap would show progress being made as things get removed from the roadmap.
- A list of of project ideas, or a list of upcoming projects
  - could be provided by a roadmap
  - a "requested feature list" might also be warranted, could fit in with the list of project ideas
  - this will make things like Google Summer of Code easier in the future.
