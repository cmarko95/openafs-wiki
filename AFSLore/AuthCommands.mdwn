[[KaServer]]

- klog -- authentication with [[KaServer]] by getting AFS service tickets and sending them to the (kernel) [[CacheManager]]. Can save the TGT in a file compatible with kinit (V4) as a non-default option.
- kpasswd -- change password in [[KaServer]]
- kas -- administrative interface to [[KaServer]]

[[KerberosIV]]

- kinit -- authenticates using standard UDP port 750. Also works with [[KaServer]] but doesn't get AFS service tickets (tokens).

[[KerberosV]]

- kinit -- authenticates using standard UDP port 88. Works with DCE, [[HeimdalKTH]] and [[ActiveDirectory]] (maybe?).

[[KerberosDCE]]

- kinit -- authenticates to DCE Security Server and also obtains authorization informaion (groups) from the DCE Privilege Server.
- chpass -- change password
- dcecp -- admin suite

[[ActiveDirectory]]

- uses its own authorization data format. Big flamefest on this issue.

Others

- aklog -- converts V5 TGT to AFS service tickets and gives them to the [[CacheManager]].
