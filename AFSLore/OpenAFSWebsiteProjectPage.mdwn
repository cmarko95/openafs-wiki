The new website should be geared towards the user and the users needs, whereas the current website tends to be more directed at the needs of the developers. Developers have entirely different needs than users, and should therefore have a specific, separate site dedicated towards them. However, this does not mean that the current site is all the developers need, just that the development site has a different set of needs, outside of the scope of a site targeted at users.

The new website should be an integrated experience for the users. Some sites to look at for design include:

- [freebsd.org](http://www.freebsd.org)
- [apache.org](http://www.apache.org)
- [mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.com)

The general consensus is that the [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) website provides a good model to provide information to a large number of different types of users, while providing a clean interface, and without being distracting.

Some effective parts of the [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) site include:

- the "Get FreeBSD"
  - this should however be more similar to the Mozilla button, that guesses at the users' platform, and suggests the recommended version of [[OpenAFS]] for this platform.
- the box at the bottom will allow for easy access to three types of information:
  - current information
  - important information that is no longer current, but still relevant
  - upcoming events or information that will be relevant
- the content in the box is also provided in RSS which allows users to follow the feeds, and access information easily
- The "New to [[FreeBSD]]" section provides information to prospective users of [[FreeBSD]], something similar is warranted
- Color scheme matching logo
  - "Power to Serve" catchy, something to remember [[FreeBSD]] by, sort of superfluous?
