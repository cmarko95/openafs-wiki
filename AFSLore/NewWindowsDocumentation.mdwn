- **WindowsAdministratorsInstallationGuide** Where to download the package. Walk-through of the installation steps. Optional steps afterwards ([[KfW]], references into the Configuration Guide.
- **WindowsEndUserQuickStartGuide** Same as above, but maybe even more Walk-Through. Explain a sample configuration. Should also include some use cases.
- **WindowsConfigurationReferenceGuide** One page for each screen of the afscreds program. Command-line switches reference.
- **WindowsTroubleshootingGuide (FAQ)** Not questions like "Where do I download [[OpenAFS]]?"
- It would be nice to write this in XML, then doing XSLT to create PDF, (online) HTML and (offline) HTML Help documents. Docbook might be suitable.
