## <a name="How to Install the _OpenAFS Clie"></a> How to Install the [[OpenAFS]] Client

This documentation provides instructions for installing the [[OpenAFS]] client only. Documentation for installing a server belongs elsewhere.

This document is intended for users who are familiar enough with administrating their operating system of choice to not need hand holding, but unfamiliar enough with [[OpenAFS]] to need basic setup instructions.

### <a name="Operation System specific instru"></a> Operation System specific instructions

#### <a name="Linux, Redhat 8"></a> Linux, Redhat 8

These are the steps I used to get [[OpenAFS]] working on a fairly standard Redhat 8 machine. These steps will also work for the other Redhat and Fedora releases since Redhat 8.

##### <a name="Download RPMS"></a> Download RPMS

Download the most current versions of these RPMS from www.openafs.org:

- openafs (Utilities, Init scripts, and documentation)
- openafs-client (AFS daemon, PAM modules, client configuration files)
- openafs-kernel (AFS kernel module, for Redhat's kernel 2.4.18-14
- openafs-krb5 (Utilities for using Kerberos 5 tickets to get AFS tokens)

You may also want:

- openafs-compat (Populate /usr/afsws with symlinks for legacy applications/users)
- openafs-devel (AFS libraries and include files, for building AFS aware applications)
- openafs-kpasswd (Compatibility package for use with a KA server)
- openafs-kernel-source (AFS kernel module source, necessary if you aren't using Redhat's kernel)

You almost certainly don't want:

- openafs-server (AFS Server binaries)

If you don't already have Redhat's kerberos 5 RPMS installed, you may wish to download those as well. But they aren't strictly necessary, and only the openafs-krb5 package depends on them.

##### <a name="Install RPMS"></a> Install RPMS

Install those RPMS. If you don't know how to do this, then this document isn't intended for you.

##### <a name="Configure AFS"></a> Configure AFS

Follow the instructions that were output during the RPM install. In particular, edit /usr/vice/etc/ThisCell.

If you you will need to [[KerberosV]] on your system. If you have not done so, do so now. Instructions for doing that are outside of the scope of this document.

##### <a name="Start AFS"></a> Start AFS

Start the AFS client, by running '/etc/rc.d/init.d/afs start'

Verify that /afs/&lt;your-cell-here&gt; is readable.

Get AFS tokens with klog, or translate existing kerberos tickets with aklog, and verify that you can modify files in AFS.

Once you've verified that AFS works correctly, you may want to configure AFS to start automatically, via whatever mechanism you prefer.
