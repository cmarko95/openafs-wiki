KTH

-- [[JeffreyHutzelman]] - 18 Jan 2002

I suppose we should let someone who really knows, or at least speaks Swedish, do the right thing here. But at the bottom of <http://www.kth.se/> it says Kungl Tekniska H�gskolan. This still doesn't make a [[WikiWord]], but changing to a plain "o" does: [[KunglTekniskaHogskolan]]. But how useful is this to non-swedish talkers? How about [[StackenKTH]]? There is also [[Kerberos4KTH]] and [[HeimdalKTH]]. It is possible to setup page/topic aliases, so that might be reasonable at some point.

I have spoken to [[LoveH]]�rnquist�strand, who knows, and he indicates that 'Kungl' is an abbreviated form. According to Love, the full form is preferable in this context. Also, note that the pages returned by TWiki are ISO-8859-1. I had no problem with '�' (not '�¶') in a [[WikiWord]], but I'll check to make sure the software is set up to deal. We owe it to our Swedish friends to make sure that their names and the name of their institution can be represented properly.
