I have spoken to [[LoveH�rnquist�strand|Main/LoveH%f6rnquist%c5strand]], who knows, and he indicates that 'Kungl' is an abbreviated form. According to Love, the full form is preferable in this context. Also, note that the pages returned by TWiki are ISO-8859-1. I had no problem with '�' (not '�¶') in a [[WikiWord]], but I'll check to make sure the software is set up to deal. We owe it to our Swedish friends to make sure that their names and the name of their institution can be represented properly.

Okay. I have found that Netscape 6.2 and Mozilla get confused when editing topic's whose name includes non-ascii characters even thought the character set is ISO-8859-1 and these characters are displayed just fine. I have a similar problem with IE 5.5.

Hm. I wonder if the real problem is not so much the browser as the operating system. I'll bet that there is some version of Windows involved, and that it's putting raw UCS-4 or something into the URL's.
