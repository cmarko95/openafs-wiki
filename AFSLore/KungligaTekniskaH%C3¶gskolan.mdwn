KTH

-- [[JeffreyHutzelman]] - 18 Jan 2002

I suppose we should let someone who really knows, or at least speaks Swedish, do the right thing here. But at the bottom of <http://www.kth.se/> it says Kungl Tekniska Hï¿½gskolan. This still doesn't make a [[WikiWord]], but changing to a plain "o" does: [[KunglTekniskaHogskolan]]. But how useful is this to non-swedish talkers? How about [[StackenKTH]]? There is also [[Kerberos4KTH]] and [[HeimdalKTH]]. It is possible to setup page/topic aliases, so that might be reasonable at some point.
