# <a name="Creating a new AFS cell"></a> Creating a new AFS cell

These are some links (and commentary) to various documents that exist online that describe creating a new AFS cell. The most common problem with a lot of existing documentation is that it has you install the kaserver, which is highly deprecated. Any new cell installation really should install a conventional kerberos server (MIT, Heimdal and the Windows Active Directory server all have been used as kerberos servers for various AFS cells).

- [OpenAFS server tutorial for Debian Squeeze](http://openafs.dk/doku.php?id=server:start). Relative new (based on Debian Squeeze).
- The [[OpenAFS]] [Quick Start Guide for Unix](http://www.openafs.org/pages/doc/QuickStartUnix/auqbg000.htm) --- derived from the Transarc 3.6 AFS document. Shows it's age in a lot of places, and takes you through using kaserver, which is highly deprecated. Still has useful information in it, however.
- The Gentoo [OpenAFS Guide](http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/openafs.xml) From the Gentoo Linux distribution. Again, takes you through using kaserver, which is highly deprecated.
- [Using NetBSD to provide AFS and Kerberos services](http://kula.tproa.net/talks/afsbpw2005) Talk from the 2005 AFS &amp; Kerb Workshop, describing how to use [[NetBSD]] to provide AFS and Kerberos services. Some steps are [[NetBSD]] specific, but there are key bits of info in there on using a Heimdal KDC as your kerberos server.
- [Using OS X to provide AFS and Kerberos services](http://kula.tproa.net/talks/afsbpw2006) Talk from the 2006 AFS &amp; Kerb Workshop, describing how to use OS X to provide AFS and Kerberos services. Some steps are OS X specific, but there are key bits of info in there on using an MIT KDC as your kerberos server.
- [[http://www.pmw.org/afsbpw06/talks/shadow-AD.pdf|Main/UtilizingActiveDirectoryAsTheAFSKDC]] (pdf) Talk from the 2006 AFS &amp; Kerb Workshop, describing how to use Active Directory as your kerberos server for an AFS cell.
- [[FedoraAFSInstall]] --- step-by-step instructions on installing an AFS server on Fedora 7 with [[KerberosV]]
- [[RpmClientInstallationWithDKMS]] --- instructions on installing the openafs cache manager with the DKMS RPM package
