I am not the right person to write this page, but here is a rough outline.

There are basically three options with several variants

- [[KaServer]] -- the standard option to comes with IBMAFS, implements [[KerberosIV]] with some custom features.
- [[KerberosIV]] -- the original MIT implementation, and [[Krb4KTH]], an export version of [[MITKerberosIV]] (aka "bones"), but with encryption support put back in by the fine folks at KTH.
- [[KerberosV]] -- version five of this protocol has numerous improvements over version four and is available from many sources: MIT, DCE, Microsoft (aka [[ActiveDirectory]]) and [[HeimdalKTH]].

The consensus these days is to use [[KerberosV]], even though lacking native support for V5, AFS still needs various conversion and migration tools.

Some other topics that should be explained.

- SSH -- There are two issues. First is mutually authenticating you and the SSH server to each other using Kerberos. Second is passing local AFS authentication to the remote shell (in this case an AFS Client) in the form of AFS service tickets (tokens).
  - these instructions from [[CharlesClancy]] for building openssh might be useful <http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2002-January/002846.html>
