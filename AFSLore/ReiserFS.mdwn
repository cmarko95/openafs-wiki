## <a name="Where can you use _ReiserFS?"></a> Where can you use [[ReiserFS]]?

There seems to be much confusion amongst new [[OpenAFS]] administrators about when and where they can use [[ReiserFS]]. This document attempts to describe supported uses, and explain why the others are unsupported.

----

### <a name="Supported:  Vice partitions on n"></a> Supported: Vice partitions on namei-based fileservers

**Why:** Namei-based fileservers store volumes in regular files on the vice partitions. No meta-data is stored in the inodes of these files.

----

### <a name="Unsupported:  Vice partitions on"></a> Unsupported: Vice partitions on inode-based fileservers

**Why:** Inode-based fileservers access volumes directly via inode, and sneakily stuff bits of volume metadata into portions of the inode structure. Since [[ReiserFS]] does not have persistent inodes, this process will not work.

----

### <a name="Unsupported:  Cache partitions o"></a> Unsupported: Cache partitions on [[OpenAFS]] clients

**Why:** The cache manager operates directly on filesystem inodes. [[ReiserFS]] does not have persistent inodes.
