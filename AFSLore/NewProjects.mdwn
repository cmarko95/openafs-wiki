## <a name="Pending Projects"></a> Pending Projects

The following are items known to be in progress, and, where available, a point of contact.

- [[DisconnectedOperation]] provides the ability to use AFS while not connected to a network.

- [[NestedGroups]] allows PTS groups to have other groups as members. Code available, waiting for [[OpenAFS]] port. In CVS head, not in 1.2 branch.

- [[FreeBSDPort]] -- Server ported. Cache manager available, not stable yet.

- [[HPUX11Port|Main/HP-UX11Port]] -- Missing RX code reconstructed. Header needed, available from HP. Available in 1.2.10.

- [[NetBSDPort]] -- No timeline available.

- [[OpenBSDPort]] -- In progress. Cache manager available, not stable yet.

- [[AutoConf]] with automake too. In progress. Contact [[DerrickBrashear]].

- [[DynamicRoot]] (/afs) support utilizing AFSDB DNS resource records is available for all UNIX ports. Windows includes similar [[FreelanceClient]] support.

- [[AtSysConfig]] allows @sys expansion from a list. Substantially complete. Contact [[TedMcCabe]].

- [[AmandaBackup]] -- Support for backup using [Amanda](http://www.amanda.org). In progress. Contact [[MitchCollinsworth]].

- [[BetterDocumentation]] -- Contact [[RenatoArruda]].

## <a name="Proposed Projects"></a> Proposed Projects

The following are items which have been proposed, but which are not yet in progress. A point of contact is included where appropriate.

- [[SupportIPv6]]

- [[KerberosV]] -- Support Kerberos version 5 and additional encryption type support. Contact [[JeffreyHutzelman]]

- [[LargeFiles]] -- Support for files over 2GB. The concensus seems to be that beyond supporting big files, large volumes already work fine. Actively in progress. R Lindsay Todd, Hartmut Reuter, and Nathan Neulinger working on this.

- [[MultipleClones]] provides support for more than one backup and read-only volume for a single read/write.

- [[SelectableUbikTieBreaker]] -- proposes to change lowest IP metric to something administrator-selectable.

- [[VolumeDumpEditor]] -- Need tool to allow editing volume dumps.

- [[WindowsIFS]] -- Implement AFS as a Windows installable file system instead of as a virtual SMB server.

- [[BetterServerPreferences]] allow selectable continuous or on-demand server preferences in clients based on available information about Rx connection round trip times instead of classful networking approach currently used. Contact [[DerrickBrashear]]. _Do this for vldb servers too, or is that a separate project? [[TedAnderson]]_

- [[NFSTranslatorServer]] -- Create an AFS/NFS translator for [[OpenAFS]] because there were licensing issues with the code in the IBM/Transarc product. A Solaris-only version will be supported with and after 1.2.8. Another approach is a user-mode implementation. Contact [[JeffreyHutzelman]].

- [[PartitionUUID]] -- Create partition UUIDs such that the vldb can be rapdily updated if a disk is moved from one machine to another. Contact [[DerrickBrashear]].

- [[ByteRangeLocks]] would improve support for applications that use them especially those on Windows platforms.
