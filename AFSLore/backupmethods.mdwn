* have a way to recover cell structure for disaster recovery
* integration of databases
* list of files in backup dump to present to users for recovery
* new more stable incarnation of butc with capability of plugging in site specific backup systems
* think of very loose coupling (not too tight integration), so that customizing for site backup system remains mannageble
* take simplest form of backup (vos dump, full & incremental), extract metadata, use site BS
* have more snapshots or PIT RO clones 
* could we have CoW file histories?
* have -omitdirs for backup/butc
* vos dump with only diffs per file dumped
* revisit XBSA API for connecting site BS

* revisit reverse incr backup? not doing 2 consecutive full backups, but having an incremental

generally: 

* DR capability
* incidental single file restore
* file-level differential
* support for different front ends
* conserve (at least)) current backup policy
* not necessarily need server local disk for backup

Site: please describe your current setup below in separate subpages.
      (if possible add restore statistics)
