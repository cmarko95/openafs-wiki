- have a way to recover cell structure for DR
- integration of databases
- list of files in backup dump to present to users for recovery
- new more stable incarnation of butc with capability ofplugging in site specific backup systems
- think f very loose coupling (not t tight integration), so that customizing for site backup system remains manageble
- take simplest form of backup (vos dump, full & incremental), extract metadata, use site BS
- have more snapshots or PIT RO clones 
- could we have CoW file histories?
- have -omitdirs for backup/butc
- vos dump with only diffs per file dumped
- revisit XBSA API for conecting site BS

- revisit reverse incr backup? not doing 2 consec full backups, but having an incremental

generaly: 
 - DR capability
 - incidental single file restore
 - file-level differential
 - support for different front ends
 - conserve (at least)) current backup policy
 - not neccesarily need server local disk for backup
