Every AFS file server machine must have at least one partition or logical volume dedicated to storing AFS volumes. Each server partition is mounted at a directory named /vicepxx, where xx is one or two lowercase letters. The /vicepxx directories must reside in the file server machine's root directory, not in one of its subdirectories (for example, /usr/vicepa is not an acceptable directory location). For additional information, see Performing Platform-Specific Procedures.

To configure server partitions on an AIX system, perform the following procedures:

1. Create a directory called /vicepxx for each AFS server partition you are configuring (there must be at least one). Repeat the command for each partition.

       # mkdir /vicepxx

1. Use the SMIT program to create a journaling file system on each partition to be configured as an AFS server partition.

1. Mount each partition at one of the /vicepxx directories. Choose one of the following three methods:

\* Use the SMIT program

\* Use the mount -a command to mount all partitions at once

\* Use the mount command on each partition in turn

Also configure the partitions so that they are mounted automatically at each reboot. For more information, refer to the AIX documentation.
