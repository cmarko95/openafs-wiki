I am not the right person to write this page but here is a start:

The MIT web site for Kerberos is <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www>. The FAQ is at <http://www.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html>.

[[KenHornstein]]'s AFS-Kerberos5 migration toolkit is here: <ftp://ftp.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/pub/kerberos5/>.

[[DerrickBrashear]]'s document for converting from the [[KaServer]] to [[HeimdalKTH]] is here: <file:/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr/shadow/ka2heim.txt>

Some other issues to explain:

- PAM modules available for K5
- Admin differences between various K5 implementations
- krb524d -- which uses a K5 TGT to produce a V4 AFS service ticket which the [[CacheManager]] needs. It does not need to run on the same machine as the [[KerberosV]] server but just needs access to the AFS principal's key. This is not needed for [[HeimdalKTH]] which implements V4 and V5 services, but is for MIT and [[ActiveDirectory]].
- encryption types -- this is a per key property and V5 supports several (while V4 only supported one, namely what V5 calls des-cbc-crc). However, this is not the V5 default (which I think is des3) so you need to ensure that the AFS principal uses des-cbc-crc.
- [[StringToKey]] differences
