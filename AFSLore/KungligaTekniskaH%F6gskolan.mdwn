Just a test to see if I can edit this page using Netscape 4.78. Lynx also works.

Okay, looks good. I have found that Netscape 6.2 and Mozilla get confused when editing topic's whose name includes non-ascii characters even thought the character set is ISO-8859-1 and these characters are displayed just fine. I have a similar problem with IE 5.5.
