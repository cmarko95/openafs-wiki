There was a [discussion](http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2001-December/002215.html) of this idea on [[OpenAFSDevel]].

[[NathanNeulinger]] outlined a two stage approach. I outlined some ideas for handling the multi-client cache coherence problem. But the discussion died down leaving some uncertainty about the basic feasibility of the feature.
