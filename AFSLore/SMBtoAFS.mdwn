# <a name="Using Samba as an AFS gateway"></a> Using Samba as an AFS gateway

Recently I've been researching methods of using Samba as an AFS gateway. Below are my findings so far. Please feel free to add/correct stuff. -- [[DanielClark]] - 04 Aug 2002

## <a name="Plain text passwords sent over n"></a> Plain text passwords sent over network

In these solutions the plain text password is sent over the network. This requires [[EnablePlainTextPassword]] be set on your Windows hosts. Plain text passwords are necessary with stock Samba because the method that SMB uses for secure authentication is not compatible with Kerberos. Therefore the Samba server must have your plain text password so it can in turn get you AFS tokens using your password.

Advantages:

- No new software needs to be installed on clients
- Only required change on clients is to set a registry key

Disadvantages:

- Passwords sent in plain text over the network
- Clients may initially try to use plain text passwords to login to SMB servers other than the AFS gateway
- Client gets no warning before AFS tokens expire
- To get new tokens, client must unmap and then remap the drive letter corresponding to the AFS gateway

### <a name="Compile Samba 2 --with-pam"></a> Compile Samba 2 --with-pam

This causes Samba to use pluggable authentication modules (PAM) for authentication. PAM is available on many Unix variants, notably Linux and Solaris. There are PAM modules for the various Kerberos implementations that work with AFS; the module for the default kaserver comes with [[OpenAFS]]. For some more info on PAM see the [Samba doc](http://de.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/htmldocs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.html#PAM). Many precompiled versions of Samba are built with this option (i.e. Redhat's Samba RPMs)

Advantages:

- The only method that is integrated into Samba core and pretty much guaranteed to be maintained and work with all future Samba releases, as it is generally useful to people for purposes other then using Samba as an AFS gateway. There seem to be no people on the Samba core team that have an active interest in AFS.

Disadvantages:

- Doesn't work with operating systems that do not support PAM.

### <a name="Compile Samba 2 --with-afs"></a> Compile Samba 2 --with-afs

This links Samba against AFS authentication code directly.

Advantages:

- May work with systems that do not support PAM.

Disadvantages:

- Not actively maintained. Author states the option may be suffering from bit rot.
- Several people have mentioned difficulty getting the library and header paths right, mentioning conflicts between [[OpenAFS]], [[OpenSSL]] and non-AFS Kerberos libraries and header files. It is unclear if this code is works with the latest Samba and [[OpenAFS]] releases at all.
- May need to hunt around on the internet for a patch to make this work against a specific OS type and Samba version, and then use that older Samba version.
  - Patch for AIX / Samba 2.0.4b: <http://www.mail-archive.com/info-afs@transarc.com/msg02493.html>

## <a name="No plain text passwords sent ove"></a> No plain text passwords sent over network

These are methods that avoid sending plain text passwords over the network.

Advantages:

- Increased security

Disadvantages:

- Requires modifications to stock Samba distribution
- Requires additional infrastructure beyond Samba
- All are primarily internal projects that people did for their employers, support may be minimal to nonexistent.

### <a name="kSAMBA"></a> kSAMBA

kSamba is used for AFS translation in University of Michigan Campus sites. It also allows Windows workstations to authenticate and connect to UNIX SMB (Server Message Block) servers via a Kerberos out-of-band negotiation. This allows users to connect without entering a SMB password. A version of Samba 2.0.6 modified to support AFS and Kerberos is implemented on the server side.

  <tr>
    <td> Email </td>
    <td><a href="mailto:ifs.via.samba@umich.edu">ifs.via.samba@umich.edu</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Advantages:

- Very good security. Plain text passwords are not required to be sent over the network or kept on the Samba server.
- Has been in active use by a good number of clients for several years.
- Looks like it might have an interface to manipulate AFS permissions - see <http://lists.samba.org/pipermail/samba/1997-November/033982.html>

Disadvantages:

- Seems to be pretty specific to UMich's site - unclear if anyone else is using it.
- Requires each Windows client to install some software
  - Windows client software doesn't seem to be open source
  - Windows client software won't install on Windows 2000 or XP
- Looks like it may be tied to a specific Kerberos implementation
- Must run Samba 2.0.6 or do some porting to newer version

### <a name="SMBKlog"></a> SMBKlog

SMBKlog uses out-of-band authentication over SSL. The server sends the client an RSA public key - the client encrypts the password with the public key and sends it to the server, which then decrypts it. There is an email explaining it at <http://samba.cadcamlab.org/lists/samba-technical/Jul2001/00363.html> .

  <tr>
    <td> Email </td>
    <td> Jason Robertson <a href="mailto:jason.v.robertson@intel.com">jason.v.robertson@intel.com</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Advantages:

- Password not sent over network in plain text
- Not specific to any particular Kerberos/AFS implementation [ Transarc/OpenAFS OK ]
- Uses [[OpenSSL]] so probably relatively easy to write new Windows clients
- Successfully used at Intel to comply with corporate security requirements

Disadvantages:

- Password exists in plain text form on Samba server, at least in memory, for some period of time (Samba server decrypts password to plaintext form and uses that to get AFS tokens)
- Requires each Windows client to install some software
  - Windows client software dies on Windows 2000 and XP [ May be fixed in current version ]
- Must run specific Samba version or do some porting to newer version [ Should be straightforward ]
- Not under heavy active development.

Updates:

- Frank Cameron (<cameron@ctc.com>) updated Jason's smbklog patches to work with Samba 2.2.7
  - [samba-2.2.7-afstoken.patch](http://www.dementia.org/twiki//view/samba-2.2.7-afstoken.patch): Updated smbklog patch for Samba 2.2.7

### <a name="FOKSTRAUT"></a> FOKSTRAUT

**Fokstraut and Samba - Dealing with Authentication and Performance Issues On A Large Scale Samba Service**

Robert Beck &amp; Steve Holstead, _University of Alberta_

**Abstract**

At the University of Alberta, we have approximately 55,000 user id's using central services authenticated by Kerberos. We use AFS for central file service. We use Samba to provide Windows compatible access to much of our central file service. Samba contains a number of useful features for Microsoft Windows compatibility, including a kludge to deal with the problem of Windows sending an all uppercase version of a user's password. We observed that when Windows connects to a share, it frequently attempts many incorrect passwords repeatedly before trying the correct one. This created a very heavy authentication load on our central Samba service when users would connect every morning and authenticate. We observed this load and noticed that most of our problems were caused by repeated attempts to authenticate, and the high cost of checking these attempts.

To help reduce the load due to authentication, we implemented FOKSTRAUT, a set of modifications to Samba to cache recent password failures and successes in a DBM database built by the Samba server as it runs. By caching the recent failures we avoid expensive re-checks of the (many) other passwords Windows likes to send us. We also cache the correct case of the real password, and by doing so we avoid the expensive overhead of "cracking" an all uppercase password When Windows decides to send one. We also use FOKSTRAUT to cache the NT and LanMan password hashes of a users password once we see a successful authentication. This then allows us to use the newer Windows NT password hash after the user has connected once, without having to centrally convert and maintain a large SMB password file, and while maintaining the ability of our server to access services such as AFS which can not be authenticated against using the Windows password hash alone. Performance on our service has been drastically improved since the implementation of FOKSTRAUT.

Advantages:

- Password not sent over network in plain text
- In use for several years with a large number of clients
- Has advantages other than secure AFS login
- Seems to be under active development
  - Support for automatic reauthentication before token lifetime ends recently added
- Requires no changes to Windows Clients. This is a unique feature of this method.
- Everything is under BSD style license terms

Disadvantages:

- Requires some out-of-band secure infrastructure for users to change their passwords.
  - Authors mention using a simple script on a login server in which a user can make an SMB connect and authenticate themselves. Unsure of the security of this solution.
  - Another possibility would be a web application behind an SSL server running on the same host as the Samba server.
- Passwords must be stored in cleartext on the Samba server.

### <a name="Samba 3 built-in AFS support"></a> Samba 3 built-in AFS support

It looks like Samba 3.0.4 has built-in AFS support (perhaps only for the Kerberos 4 kaserver on GNU/Linux with [[OpenAFS]] however). The relevant configure option looks like:

      --with-fake-kaserver    Include AFS fake-kaserver support (default=no)

Also based on <http://us4.samba.org/samba/ftp/pre/WHATSNEW-3-0-5pre1.txt> it looks like Samba 3.0.5 will have support to display and set AFS acls via the NT security editor.

Here are some relevant comments from the Samba 3.0.4 code (author's homepage is at <http://www.sernet.de/vl/> ):

    ./source/lib/afs.c:
    /*
      This routine takes a radical approach completely bypassing the
      Kerberos idea of security and using AFS simply as an intelligent
      file backend. Samba has persuaded itself somehow that the user is
      actually correctly identified and then we create a ticket that the
      AFS server hopefully accepts using its KeyFile that the admin has
      kindly stored to our secrets.tdb.

      Thanks to the book "Network Security -- PRIVATE Communication in a
      PUBLIC World" by Charlie Kaufman, Radia Perlman and Mike Speciner
      Kerberos 4 tickets are not really hard to construct.

      For the comments "Alice" is the User to be auth'ed, and "Bob" is the
      AFS server.
    */

    ./source/lib/afs_settoken.c:
    /*
      Put an AFS token into the Kernel so that it can authenticate against
      the AFS server. This assumes correct local uid settings.

      This is currently highly Linux and OpenAFS-specific. The correct API
      call for this would be ktc_SetToken. But to do that we would have to
      import a REALLY big bunch of libraries which I would currently like
      to avoid.
    */

### <a name="kimpersonate"></a> kimpersonate

The major problem when exporting the AFS filespace read-write to SMB (Windows fileshareing) using Samba is the transfer of the user token to the smb-server. The simple may is to use clear-text password between the Windows client and the samba-server, and then to get tokens for the user with this password. This solution is clearly not acceptable for security aware AFS administrators.

On solution is to use \`kimpersonate' + store afs key on fileserver. To obtain the kimersonate code contact "Love H�rnquist-�strand" &lt; lha () stacken ! kth ! se &gt;

Here are some references to this technique:

- <https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2003-July/010026.html>
- <http://www.mail-archive.com/openafs-info@openafs.org/msg08471.html>
- <http://openbsd.mirrors.pair.com/src/usr.sbin/afs/src/doc/arla.info>
- <http://www.it.kth.se/~aep/licentiate/PB-lanman2001.pdf>

Here is the kimpersonate **README**:

    kimpersonate
    ============

    kimpersonate takes a keytab/srvtab/AFS KeyFile and impersonates
    kerberos credental case for a user. See manpage for documentation.

    Very useful when using with samba.

    Using kimpersonate with SAMBA
    =============================

    entry in smb.conf

            root preexec = /usr/samba/bin/su-user-login '%u'

    Also see the su-user-login file, note that this file contains hacks
    that parses the %u for samba 3.0-alpha22 something using domain
    logins. Check that is matches your usage.

    You need to make sure that somehow the samba does a afs setpag call
    before calling afslog/aklog. See the patch
    samba-setpag-patch-linux-and-freebsd above.

Here is a text rendition the kimpersonate-1.0 **man page**:

    KERBEROS(SECTION)                    LOCAL                   KERBEROS(SECTION)

    NAME
         kimpersonate - impersonate a user when there exist a srvtab, keyfile or
         KeyFile

    SYNOPSIS
         kimpersonate [-s string | --server=string] [-c string | --client=string]
                      [-k string | --keytab=string] [-4 | --krb4] [-5 | --krb5]

         --verbose
                 Verbose output

         --version
                 Print version

         --help

    FILES
         Uses /etc/krb5.keytab, /etc/srvtab and /usr/afs/etc/KeyFile when avalible
         and the the -k is used with appropriate prefix.

    EXAMPLES
         kimpersonate can be used in samba root preexec option or for debugging.
         kimpersonate -s host/hummel.e.kth.se@E.KTH.SE -c lha@E.KTH.SE -5 --no-
         krb4 will create a Kerberos 5 ticket for lha@E.KTH.SE for the host hum-
         mel.e.kth.se if there exist a keytab entry for it in /etc/krb5.keytab

         kimpersonate -k krb4:/etc/srvtab -s host/hummel.e.kth.se@E.KTH.SE -c
         lha@E.KTH.SE --no-krb5 -4 will create a Kerberos 4 ticket for
         lha@E.KTH.SE for the host hummel.e.kth.se if there exist a srvtab entry
         for it in /etc/srvtab Note the Kerberos 5 syntax of the server.
