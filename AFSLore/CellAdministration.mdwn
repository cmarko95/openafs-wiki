Administering an AFS Cell has many aspects. The care and feeding of the users, clients and servers is a traditional component of system administration, but the scale of some AFS installations provides some new challenges. Two of these are [[OrganizingNameSpace]] and [[ManagingVolumes]].

Some tools have been written to help. The `scout` command provides a view of servers and partition, `uss` simplifies creation of user accounts, and the [[ControlCenter]] provides a more friendly graphical interface to many admin tasks.

Some AFS sites have develop their own tools: CMU, Morgan Stanley, and others. (need list here and pointers to descriptions and tools) Some of these are in [afs-contrib](http://grand.central.org/twiki/bin/view/AFSLore/ResourcesFAQ#4_01_Is_there_an_anonymous_FTP_s) and others maybe available from the sites themselves.

[[LeoShyhWeiLuan]] has proposed a [[JavaAPI]] to simplify writing and sharing tools.

There is also a Perl API, written by Roland Schemers and now maintained by Norbert E. Grï¿½ner and described on his [home page](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~nog/), which provides access to many of the AFS programming API. It even has [documentation](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~nog/doc/afsindex.htm).
