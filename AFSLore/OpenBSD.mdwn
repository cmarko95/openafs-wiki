[[OpenBSD]] ( <http://www.openbsd.org> ) uses the **arla** ( <http://www.stacken.kth.se/projekt/arla/> ) AFS implementation for the **client** side in **base install**. **Server** side is just **semi-functional** with arla (see <http://www.deadly.org/article.php3?sid=20030214030848> [plus follow-ups] and <http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2002-November/007117.html> [plus follow-ups]). The installation of [[OpenAFS]] on [[OpenBSD]] 3.2 seems to be expert-only (only from snapshots, I couldn't manage to get it compiled). [[OpenBSD]] 2.9 is supported via './configure --with-afs-sysname=i386\_obsd29' in [[OpenAFS]] 1.2.8 (stable) and 1.3.2 (unstable) but didn't compile on by [[OpenBSD]] 3.2 box. Jim Rees ( <rees@umich.edu> ), who seems to be doing the openbsd port of [[OpenAFS]] doesn't provide instruction either (see <http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/rees/> and <http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2002-November/007122.html> [plus follow-ups]), which I'd definitely need to get it going...
