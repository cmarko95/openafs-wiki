[[OpenBSD]] ( <http://www.openbsd.org> ) uses the **arla** ( <http://www.stacken.kth.se/projekt/arla/> ) AFS implementation for the **client** side in **base install**. **Server** side is just **semi-functional** with arla (see <http://www.deadly.org/article.php3?sid=20030214030848> [plus follow-ups] and <http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2002-November/007117.html> [plus follow-ups]). The installation of [[OpenAFS]] on [[OpenBSD]] 3.2 is a bit of an effort, but Jim Rees ( <rees@umich.edu> ), who seems to be doing the openbsd port of [[OpenAFS]] ( <http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/rees/> ) is pretty active on the openafs-info-list ( <http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/2002-November/007122.html> [plus follow-ups]), and there is an [[OpenBSD]] Chapter in the newer (snapshot) READMEs. Good Luck nonetheless.
