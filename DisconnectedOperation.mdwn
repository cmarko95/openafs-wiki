In addition to being endemic to Coda, [[CITI]] created a version of AFS which supports disconnecting from the network while letting the client continue to access data in it's cache, and to write data for resynchronization upon reconnection to the network.

This code was later ported to Arla and my understanding is as of this date requires some work before it will be useful.
