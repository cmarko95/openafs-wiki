# Testing the OpenAFS codebase

We have the start of a unit test suite, based on Russ's c-tap harness.
Some information about getting started writing such a test is
available at
http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/writing.html

Such tests as exist are run by 'make check'.

A Robot Framework based test suite has been started and is available on github.
At this point, the test suite will install the OpenAFS client and server
binaries and create a simple small cell.
