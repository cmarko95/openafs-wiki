### 4.03 Where can I get training in AFS?

IBM/Transarc has provided user and administrator courses. Those who have obtained it recently say that IBM is reluctant to provide training but will do so for a lot of money.

Training in AFS has been offered recently at the LISA conference and at the AFS Best Practices Workshops, both offered annually. Keep an eye on <http://www.openafs.org> for news about future training in these venues.

### 4.04 Where can I find AFS resources in World Wide Web (WWW)?

Here are some I have found (please let me know if you find more):

- A collection of AFS information maintained by Derrick Brashear at CMU:<br /><http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr/shadow/www/afs.html> (Also accessible in: /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr/shadow/www)

- AFS Tutorial (ALW/NIH):<br />[http://www.alw.nih.gov/Documentation/AFS\_tutorial.html](http://www.alw.nih.gov/Documentation/AFS_tutorial.html)

### 4.05 Is there a mailing list for AFS topics?

There are a bunch of [[OpenAFS]] mailing lists. A list is available at <https://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/> .

The [[OpenAFS]]-Info and [[OpenAFS]]-devel lists are probably the most active.

### 4.06 Where can I find an archive of <info-afs@transarc.com>?

There is a web archive at: <http://diswww.mit.edu/menelaus/info-afs/>

### 4.09 Gibt es eine deutsche AFS Benutzer Gruppe?

Ja, wenn Sie mitmachen wollen, schicken Sie bitte eine E-Mail an:

<afsdeu-request@hrz.tu-darmstadt.de>

Ueber diese Adresse werden "subscribe" und "unsubscribe" Requests bearbeitet.

### 4.10 Donde puedo encontrar informacion en Espanol sobre AFS?

Hay algunas notas en Espanol sobre AFS en: <http://w3.ing.puc.cl/~cet/afs.html>

### 4.11 Are there books on AFS?

"Managing AFS: The Andrew File System" by Richard Campbell was published by Prentice-Hall in February, 1998. It is supposedly out of print, but somehow there is always a copy or two available from Amazon [here.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0138027293/qid%3D1023720253/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/104-0953845-2989550.)

Recently a new book has come out, "Distributed Services with [[OpenAFS]]: for Enterprise and Education" by Wolfgang A. Gehrke and Franco Milicchio. It's also available [through Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Services-OpenAFS-Enterprise-Education/dp/3540366334/ref=pd_sim_b) and probably through most other on-line and brick-and-mortar stores. I (Steve Simmons) checked with a co-worker who has read it. He describes it as good for people who've not seen AFS before and might be setting up from scratch.

### 4.12 Where can I find tools to use with AFS?

A collection of AFS management tools used at Stanford University can be found at <http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/> in the AFS section. Included in this collection are tools for handling volume creation, volume deletion, and migrating volumes, a tool for comparing read/write and read-only volumes, tools for monitoring AFS with Nagios, tools for tracking mount point locations for volumes, and some user utilities like a recursive wrapper around fs and a utility to find mount points in a file tree.

### 4.13 Where can I find stuff from the old transarc.com web site?

Many of the links to transarc.com in the FAQ, and around the web are broken. The best bet seems to be to use the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org) to search the Internet Archive for old versions of the pages from transarc.com and transarc.ibm.com. Here is one place to start, but things are sometimes missing so you may have to search for older copies and alternate paths.

Here is the [AFS 3.6 Documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20010604011953/http://www.transarc.ibm.com/Library/documentation/afs/3.6/unix/en_US/HTML/index.htm) and [AFS for Windows](http://web.archive.org/web/20010529113949/www.transarc.ibm.com/Library/documentation/afs/3.6/windows/en_US/html/index.htm).
