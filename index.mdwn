Welcome to the [OpenAFS][2] wiki. This is a web-based collaboration for
collecting, maintaining, and distributing information about OpenAFS, an
open-source implementation of the AFS distributed filesystem.

OpenAFS is a caching, distributed, network-based filesystem for securely and
efficiently sharing files over a private network or over the internet.  OpenAFS
stores files on file servers. OpenAFS clients read and write data to
the file servers. Data is cached locally by clients, making subsequent reads
very fast.  File servers automatically notify clients when data is
changed, keeping data in sync.  OpenAFS clients integrate with the client
operating system to create a seamless network file system.  Client side support
is provided for wide-range of operating systems, including Windows, MacOS,
Solaris, and Linux.
