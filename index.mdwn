Welcome to the [OpenAFS](http://www.openafs.org) wiki. This is a web-based
collaboration area for collecting, maintaining, and distributing information
about OpenAFS, an open-source implementation of the AFS distributed filesystem.

OpenAFS is a caching, distributed, network-based filesystem for securely and
efficiently sharing files over a private network or over the internet. OpenAFS
has support for a wide-range of clients, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux
clients. Unix based file servers are supported, including Linux, Solaris, and
other unix based servers.

OpenAFS requires a Kerberos 5 realm for mutual authentication of users and
servers. Supported kerberos 5 implementations include Active Directory, MIT
Kerberos, or Hiemdal kerberos.

### Features ###

* global namespace
* location transparency
* client-side caching
* read-only replication
