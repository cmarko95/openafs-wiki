Welcome to the [OpenAFS](http://www.openafs.org) wiki. This is a web-based
collaboration area for collecting, maintaining, and distributing information
about OpenAFS, an open-source implementation of the AFS distributed filesystem.

OpenAFS is a caching, distributed, network-based filesystem for securely and
efficiently sharing files over a private network or over the internet.  OpenAFS
stores files on file server machines. OpenAFS clients read and write data to
the file servers. Data is cached locally by clients, making subsequent reads
very fast.  File servers automatically notify clients when when data is
changed, keeping data in sync.  OpenAFS clients integrate with the client
operating system to create a seamless network file system.  Client side support
is provided for wide-range of operating systems, including Windows, MacOS,
Solaris, and Linux.

OpenAFS requires a Kerberos 5 realm for mutual authentication of users and
servers. Kerberos implementations include Active Directory, MIT Kerberos, and
Heimdal kerberos.
