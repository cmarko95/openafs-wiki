In this section we will create a shared project work space and give multiple
users read and write access to it.

1. As admin, create the users (kerberos and pts): follow the steps from [[OpenAFS Tutorial Setup]] under the Creating regular users section.

2. As admin, create a new prefix-less group and add members to it. First check the existing groups. Then create the group and add members.
    kinit admin
    aklog
    pts listentries -g
    pts creategroup -name <new group>
    pts adduser <user> <new group>
    pts membership <new group>

3. As admin, create a shared "project" volume. Mount the volume, and grant the group access rights.
    vos create afs01 a project.<new group> -m 0
    fs mkmount /afs/yoyodyne.com/<new group> project.<new group>
    fs sa /afs/yoyodyne.com/<new group>/ <new group> write
    touch /afs/yoyodyne.com/<new group>/<file>
    echo "Cleveland Rocks" > /afs/yoyodyne.com/<new group>/<file>
    cat /afs/yoyodyne.com/<new group>/<file>
