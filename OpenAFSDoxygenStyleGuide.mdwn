NOTE: This is a work in progress.

An example doxygen comment,

    /*!
     * find the first occurrence of a volume header file and return the path.
     *
     * \param[out] ec          outbound error code
     * \param[in]  volumeId    volume id to find
     * \param[out] partitionp  pointer to disk partition path string
     * \param[out] namep       pointer to volume header file name string
     *
     * \post path to first occurrence of volume header is returned in partitionp
     *       and namep, or ec is set accordingly.
     *
     * \warning this function is NOT re-entrant -- partitionp and namep point to
     *          static data segments
     *
     * \note if a volume utility inadvertently leaves behind a stale volume header
     *       on a vice partition, it is possible for callers to get the wrong one,
     *       depending on the order of the disk partition linked list.
     *
