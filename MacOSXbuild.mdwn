To build on Mountain Lion, make sure you have Xcode and Packagemaker, and the following configure/build options have been reported to work:

    ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" ./configure --enable-transarc-paths \
    --with-krb5-conf=/usr/bin/krb5-config --enable-warnings --enable-checking
    ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" make dest

and then the installer is created, as root:

    ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" make packages
