# Building RPM packages for OpenAFS

The OpenAFS source tree contains an RPM spec file for building RPM packages.
Recent versions of OpenAFS have makefile targets to build the source
distribution tarballs and a source RPM package (srpm). After creating these
files, run the `rpmbuild` tool to create create the binary RPM packages.

The following commands show how to build RPM packages from a git checkout.  The
tools will create RPM packages from annotated git tags. Checkout a tag for the
desired version, then generated the source rpm, then run rpmbuild to build the
binaries RPM package files.

    $ git clone git://git.openafs.org/openafs.git
    $ cd openafs
    $ git checkout openafs-stable-<version>  # NOTE: replace dots with underscores in version number
    $ ./regen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make dist
    $ make srpm
    $ rpmbuild --rebuild -ba --define "_topdir $(pwd)/rpmbuild" packages/openafs-<version>-1.src.rpm

The packages will be created in the `rpmbuild/RPMS` directory.  See the RPM
spec file in src/packaging/RedHat for the OpenAFS `--define` options.
