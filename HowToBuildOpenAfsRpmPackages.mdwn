## Building RPM packages
 
A script called makesrpm.pl is provided to build a source RPM package.  You can
use the generated source RPM to build the binaries and create the RPM packages
for your source code tree of OpenAFS.

The first step is to create a source tree of OpenAFS. Run the regen.sh script
to build the docs and to generate the configure script. Also, use git describe
to make a version stamp file which will be used by the packaging process. This
example shows how to get a source tree from a remote git repo.

    $ git clone git://git.openafs.org/openafs.git openafs-<version>
    $ cd openafs-<version>
    $ git checkout <tagname>
    $ git describe >.version
    $ ./regen.sh

The _version_ is the dotted OpenAFS version number, such as 1.6.0,
and the _tagname_ is the git tag for the version, such as openafs-stable-1_6_0.
The _version_ number for pre-releases are suffixed with pre<number>. For example,
to build 1.6.0pre5, create a directory called openafs-1.6.0pre5.

Next, create a source RPM file. This requires creating a tar file for the
source files and a tar file for the documents.  Run the makesrpm program
to generate an OpenAFS source RPM.

    $ cd .. # move out of the source tree
    $ tar cjf openafs-<version>-src.tar.bz2 openafs-<version> --exclude .git --exclude doc
    $ tar cjf openafs-<version>-doc.tar.bz2 openafs-<version>/doc
    $ openafs-<version>/src/packaging/RedHat/makesrpm.pl openafs-<version>-src.tar.bz2 openafs-<version>-doc.tar.bz2

At this point you should have a source RPM called `openafs-<version>-1.0.src.rpm`. See the makesrpm.pl for additional options.
The source tree and tar files are no longer needed.

Finally, run rpmbuild to build the build binary RPM packages. If all goes well, the final
output will show the destination directory and an exit code of zero.

    $ rpmbuild --rebuild openafs-<version>-1.0.src.rpm
    ...
    + cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD
    + rm -rf openafs-<version>
    + exit 0

Alternatively, the source RPM may be installed, which will place the sources in the
rpm SOURCE directory and a spec file in the rpm SPEC directory.
