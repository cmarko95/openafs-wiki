OpenAFS has a buildbot instance that is integrated with Gerrit.

The buildbot web site is at http://buildbot.openafs.org:8010/

Any changes submitted to gerrit will automatically be built by buildbot, and the results of the build will be add as a comment in gerrit.

# Todo items

  * Getting an acceptable gerrit status plugin in upstream buildbot project.
  * Upgrading the buildbot software on the buildbot master (depends on the gerrit status plugin).
  * Incorporating more testing into the build.
  * Using the buildslaves to generate release packages/tarballs. This requires a way of triggering the release builds and uploading to the web site.
