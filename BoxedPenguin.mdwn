[Boxed Penguin](http://www.boxedpenguin.com/) is a complete instant infrastructure system that allows one to start from an empty PC and bring up a small but scalable infrastructure server with a minimum of effort (installing Debian and then layering on a meta-package that configures and installs the rest.) Likewise it simplifies installing generic workstation-style clients.

Commercial support for Boxed Penguin is available from [Mekinok, Inc.](http://www.mekinok.com/), community support is available through the mailing lists on the Boxed Penguin website.
