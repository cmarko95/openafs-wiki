This document describes the proposed updates for the OpenAFS
wiki.

1. Update the version of OpenAFS to the latest stable
   release which is "1.6.21"
2. Unarchive information that is still relevant to the
   project.
3. Remove broken links and clear the orphaned pages list.
4. Sort information into admin or developer
   sections/pages/categories.
5. Maintain the Contributed docs section. This section holds
   a lot of useful information, but it needs to be sorted,
updated, and replenished.
6. Archive old FAQs page and generate a new one. It would be
   nice to incorporate the latest email exchanges that have
been sent out from the openafs-info-request mailing list.
7. Remove the list of OpenAFS sites. It is probably very
   outdated. It can always be generated again if there is a
want for a new list.
8. Remove the Tiny Simple Tasks page because that is
   automated now.
9. Update the admin page with the correct administrators to
   contact.
10. Update the mailing lists to include only the ones that
    are being maintained. Archive the old ones.

More may need to be added to this list for a thorough spring
cleaning, but this is the start for now. Please feel free to
contribute to this document and to the wiki update efforts.
This is a small part in keeping the OpenAFS project alive.
