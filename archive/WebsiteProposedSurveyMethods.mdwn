These observations have been made solely on the free versions of each of these survey providers. It's possible that some of the concerns addressed are fixed/modified in the pay-for versions.

Features deemed important to a survey service include:

- Analysis tools
- The ability to insert images into the survey
- Conditional branching based on responses provided by the user

We are currently considering multiple online surveys options including:

- www.surveymonkey.com
  - Clean interface
  - seems to be unable to use image uploads for multiple choice questions
  - ensures one cannot vote from the same computer
  - analysis seems pretty standard, in terms of options
- www.polldaddy.com
  - Very easy interface
  - seems to cut out some of the control from the admin interface
  - also unable to use images for multiple choice questions
  - also ensures 'vote stuffing' doesn't happen (no voting from the same computer multiple times)
  - conditional branching capable, but seemingly unable to make sure users only see a question if answer the initial question a different way (eg. user will eventually get to all the questions, regardless of the branching)
    - I might be mistaken, there may be a way to change this -JacobThebaultSpieker
  - analysis seems pretty standard in terms of options
- www.limeservice.com
  - full featured free account
  - interface provides substantially more control, seemingly
  - icon driven interface, kind of awkward to use
  - control over conditional branching is much better
  - statistics/analysis seems more fine-grained

Please provide any feedback you may have as to other online survey options, or your experiences with any of the services being considered.
