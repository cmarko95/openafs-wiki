Please post website content ideas here.

- All existing non-developer specific content from the existing web site
- Include links to unofficial [[OpenAFS]] tools, or tools provided by entities outside of the [[OpenAFS]] project. The links should be included within the appropriate contexts. [[MacOS]] X utilities in conjunction with the [[MacOS]] X downloads or [[MacOS]] X troubleshooting sections. Windows specific with their own. Admin specific tools with appropriate pages. Etc.
- As part of the Foundation Pages, minutes and monthly reports from Board meetings, Technical Advisory Council meetings, etc.
- A monthly newsletter summarizing the most interesting discussions on the news groups, latest releases, upcoming features, "did you know?", etc.
- It has been suggested that a project roadmap would show progress being made as things get removed from the roadmap.
- A list of of project ideas, or a list of upcoming projects could be provided by a roadmap
- a "requested feature list" might also be warranted, could fit in with the list of project ideas (Google Summer of Code)
