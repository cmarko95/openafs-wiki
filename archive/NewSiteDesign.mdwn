This is a place holder for notes on the redesign of the openafs.org website.

In particular, the new site must be designed to be accessible to various groups of users who have very different needs. Here is a [[site outline|NewSiteOutline]] which should follow these requirements:

2. [[OpenAFS]] client end users
  1. easy access to the "best" binaries for their client OS (perhaps auto-detected)

  3. development road map
