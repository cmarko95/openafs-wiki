[[OpenBSD]]

As of release 3.6, [[Arla]] is included in the default install of [[OpenBSD]], but is only sufficient for client use. See [This Article](http://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20040219090330) on <http://www.undeadly.org> for a brief bit of information on how to setup a client.

The unstable version of [[OpenAFS]] supports [[OpenBSD]]. Leading the porting effort is Jim Rees. Some relevant links:
