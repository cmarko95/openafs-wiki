Reboot the machine and log in again as the local superuser root.

       # cd /

       # shutdown -r now

       login: root
       Password: root_password

Run the AFS initialization script.

       # /etc/rc.afs

[[Confirm Cache Manager Initialization|ConfirmCacheManagerInitialization]]

## <a name="Automatically Start AFS on Syste"></a> Automatically Start AFS on System Boot

Now that you have confirmed that the AFS initialization script works correctly, take the action necessary to have it run automatically at each reboot.

Edit the AIX initialization file, /etc/inittab, adding the following line to invoke the AFS initialization script. Place it just after the line that starts NFS daemons.

       rcafs:2:wait:/etc/rc.afs > /dev/console 2>&1 # Start AFS services

(Optional) There are now copies of the AFS initialization file in both the /usr/vice/etc and /etc directories. If you want to avoid potential confusion by guaranteeing that they are always the same, create a link between them. You can always retrieve the original script from the AFS CD-ROM if necessary.

       # cd  /usr/vice/etc

       # rm  rc.afs

       # ln -s  /etc/rc.afs
