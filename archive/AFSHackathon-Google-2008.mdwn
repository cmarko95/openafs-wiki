-- Jeffrey Altman - 14 Oct 2008

Here are things we need to know for the Hackathon at Google on Monday October 27th and Tuesday October 28th.

Location: Google (Adal Conference Room off the lobby) 1500 Crittenden Avenue Mountain View, CA 94043

Handy Map Link: [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=1501+crittenden+avenue+mountain+view,+ca+94043&amp;sll=37.423088,-122.085121&amp;sspn=0.006765,0.015965&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.423906,-122.079853&amp;spn=0.006765,0.015965&amp;t=h&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=cent](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1501+crittenden+avenue+mountain+view,+ca+94043&sll=37.423088,-122.085121&sspn=0.006765,0.015965&ie=UTF8&ll=37.423906,-122.079853&spn=0.006765,0.015965&t=h&z=17&iwloc=cent)

That link is actually less than handy, but it shows you where to go.

Parking: Any parking that is not otherwise reserved for the disabled, expectant mothers, etc., is fair game. Help yourself.

Upon Arrival: You will need to sign in at reception each day. You will be asked by the welcoming system to execute an NDA, which covers anything you may learn about Google during the course of your visit, not the content of the hackathon. If you feel strongly about not executing the NDA, you can go right ahead and decline it during sign in. You won't be anywhere near employee areas so no one at Google will care if you sign it or not.

Hours: 9 AM til whenever

Meals: 9 AM daily - breakfast 12 noon daily - lunch 3 PM daily - afternoon snack

We will be supplied with unending coffee and assorted soft drinks in the morning. If we run out of drinks our Google contacts can steal some for you from the nearest microkitchen. If you want bottled water or more juice, snag it from the beverage cooler in the adjacent lobby.

Tea and regular coffee have been ordered. If you would like to have decaffeinated coffee, Leslie will make arrangements for you to see the Google Doctor during your visit, as you are clearly not well. :-)

Connectivity: You can use the handy power cords that are integrated in the meeting room table. Do not use the wired internet connections in the room! You can use the "GoogleGuest" wireless network and no password is required.

Photos: Nope. Outside only. Be good.

Recording: Audio only, no video. Be good.

Dinners: There are many choices on Castro Street in downtown Mountain View:

Amarin Thai is about at the center of things, so here's a map link there. A parking garage is directly behind this restaurant.
