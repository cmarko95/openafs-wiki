## <a name="How to Install the _OpenAFS Clie"></a> How to Install the [[OpenAFS]] Client

This documentation provides instructions for installing the [[OpenAFS]] client only. Documentation for installing a server belongs elsewhere.

This document is intended for users who are familiar enough with administrating their operating system of choice to not need hand holding, but unfamiliar enough with [[OpenAFS]] to need basic setup instructions.

### <a name="Operation System specific instru"></a> Operation System specific instructions

#### <a name="Linux, Redhat 8"></a> Linux, Redhat 8

These are the steps I used to get [[OpenAFS]] working on a fairly standard Redhat 8 machine. These steps will also work for the other Redhat and Fedora releases since Redhat 8.

##### <a name="Download RPMS"></a> Download RPMS

Download the most current versions of these RPMS from www.openafs.org:

- openafs (Utilities, Init scripts, and documentation)
- openafs-client (AFS daemon, PAM modules, client configuration files)
- openafs-kernel (AFS kernel module, for Redhat's kernel 2.4.18-14
- openafs-krb5 (Utilities for using Kerberos 5 tickets to get AFS tokens)

You may also want:

- openafs-compat (Populate /usr/afsws with symlinks for legacy applications/users)
- openafs-devel (AFS libraries and include files, for building AFS aware applications)
- openafs-kpasswd (Compatibility package for use with a KA server)
- openafs-kernel-source (AFS kernel module source, necessary if you aren't using Redhat's kernel)

You almost certainly don't want:

- openafs-server (AFS Server binaries)

If you don't already have Redhat's kerberos 5 RPMS installed, you may wish to download those as well. But they aren't strictly necessary, and only the openafs-krb5 package depends on them.

##### <a name="Install RPMS"></a> Install RPMS

Install those RPMS. If you don't know how to do this, then this document isn't intended for you.

##### <a name="Configure AFS"></a> Configure AFS

Follow the instructions that were output during the RPM install. In particular, edit /usr/vice/etc/ThisCell.

If you you will need to [[KerberosV]] on your system. If you have not done so, do so now. Instructions for doing that are outside of the scope of this document.

##### <a name="Start AFS"></a> Start AFS

Start the AFS client, by running '/etc/rc.d/init.d/afs start'

Verify that /afs/&lt;your-cell-here&gt; is readable.

Get AFS tokens with klog, or translate existing kerberos tickets with aklog, and verify that you can modify files in AFS.

Once you've verified that AFS works correctly, you may want to configure AFS to start automatically, via whatever mechanism you prefer.

You will need at least a 4GB card to download all the necessary software and linux kernel

Much of this is taken from <http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=71&t=17666>

A wiki that is kept more up to date at <https://samvinna.ru.is/projects/projects/devnet-documentation/wiki/AFS_Client_Installation>

Other guides:
rpi-update at <https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update/>

To get started:
Install the latest dist and necessary tools

    sudo bash
    apt-get update
    apt-get -y dist-upgrade
    apt-get -y install gcc make git build-essential dkms

Install rpi-update and grab the latest firmware

    cd rpi-update
    apt-get install ca-certificates
    sudo wget http://goo.gl/1BOfJ -O /usr/bin/rpi-update && sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-update

Grab latest kernel

    cd /usr/src
    wget  https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tarball/rpi-3.2.27 -O rpi-3.2.27.tgz
    tar xzf rpi-3.2.27.tgz

Grab the configs from the kernel

    cd raspberrypi-linux-*
    zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
    make oldconfig
    make modules_prepare

Get the module symbol version 

    wget https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/raw/master/extra/Module.symvers
Make symlinks for the build system

    KSRC=`pwd`
    pushd /lib/modules/`uname -r`
    ln -s ${KSRC} source
    ln -s ${KSRC} build
    popd
    pushd /usr/src
    ln -s ${KSRC} linux-`uname -r`
    ln -s ${KSRC} linux
    popd

Install kerberos packages

    apt-get install krb5-auth-dialog krb5-user krb5-clients libpam-ccreds libpam-krb5

Install the afs client and related modules

    apt-get install  openafs-modules-dkms openafs-{client,krb5}

if it doesn't go successfuly, you can re-run it with:

    dpkg-reconfigure openafs-modules-dkms
