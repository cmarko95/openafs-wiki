clients and servers.  Read the [OpenAFS documentation](http://docs.openafs.org/)

## Planning ##

This section outlines some considerations when planning a new OpenAFS
installation.

### Servers ###

An OpenAFS installation requires one or more servers for file storage. These
may be physical or virtual machines, running a unix-like operating system, such
as Solaris, Linux, *BSD.  Not all the servers for a site need to be running the
same architecture and operating system, and it is not uncommon to have a
mixture of file servers running different operating systems or versions.  Each
file storage servers should have one or more unix filesystem partitions for
data and AFS-metadata storage. The files stored in these partitions can only be
accessed using a machine running the AFS client software.

The file server machines must support IPv4 and may have multiple interfaces.
By default, OpenAFS will try to use all the non-loopback interfaces available
on a file server machine. A configuration can be used to set which addresses
are actually reachable by clients.

In addition to the file servers, OpenAFS provides a specialized lookup service
for AFS clients and file servers, the so called AFS database servers. In a
recommended configuration, a set of three dedicated machines, physical or
virtual, are setup as AFS database servers. It is important to have good
availability of the hosts running the database service, and ideally, the IP
addresses of these hosts should be changed infrequently.

OpenAFS file servers and database servers are administratively grouped into a
collection called a 'cell'. By convention, a cell name matches an internet
domain name registered by the organization running the AFS cell. An
organization may have multiple cells.

### Kerberos ###

OpenAFS uses Kerberos v5 to authenticate users and processes accessing files in
the AFS filesystem, and to authenticate administrators when running
administrative commands. This security model avoids trusting the client machines
for user authentication, even if a user is becomes 'root' on a client.

A Kerberos v5 realm needs to be available before setting up OpenAFS.  An
existing Kerberos realm can be used or a new realm will need to be setup.
Kerberos 5 implementations such as Active Directory, MIT Kerberos V, or Heimdal
are commonly used.  For compatibility with older versions of AFS, OpenAFS
includes a deprecated, Kerberos 4 implementation called `kaserver`.  You may
see it mentioned in various older how-to guides, however `kaserver` should not
be used for new installations of OpenAFS.

### Time Synchronization ###

Kerberos requires servers and clients to have good clock synchronization,
using `ntp` or some other synchronization mechanism. Be sure ntp is installed
and working on every machine to be used as an OpenAFS client or server.


### Firewalls ###
