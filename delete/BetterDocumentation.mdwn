This project has started and is trying to at least initially move all the
[IBM/Transarc Documentation](http://www.openafs.org/doc/index.htm) into latex,
and then update it so it actually reflects the [[OpenAFS]] releases.

From the latex sources you can build the manual into whatever format you wish.
I believe the [User
Guide](http://www.openafs.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/openafs-doc/userGuide.tex) is
done.

Feel free to send patches, corrections, improvements and suggestions to Renato
Arruda.
