The [[KaServer]] is an implementation of [[KerberosIV]] that comes with AFS ([[OpenAFS]] still includes the kaserver, but it's suggested you instead install a [[KerberosV]] implementation to use in its place). It implements the standard version 4 UDP interface on port 750, but also suplements this with an [[RxRPC]] interface.

The [[RxRPC]] interface provides authentication services and is used by klog. It differs from the V4 interface in that it requires pre-authentication which avoids a problem identified with the V4 protocol and fixed in [[KerberosV]]. There is an option to the [[KaServer]] to disable port 750 but while improving security it reduces compatibility with non-AFS V4 applications.

The administration interface of V4 is not supported but instead is replaced by functions of the [[RxRPC]] interface which utilizes the transactional and replication features of [[UBIK]]. The user interface command for the admin functions are kas and kpasswd.
