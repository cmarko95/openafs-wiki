## <a name="Linux _OpenAFS Installation Tool"></a> Linux [[OpenAFS]] Installation Tools

In the [[OpenAFS]] source tree, in the src/tools/install dircetory, there are scripts that can configure [[OpenAFS]] server/clients for Linux instantly. Yes, it's that easy. The tools are meant to be used with the Red Hat rpms available from <http://www.openafs.org>. Wouldn't it make sense if they were in RPM form? Well now they are.

- [[openafs-tools-cmd-1.2.5-1.i386.rpm]]: [[OpenAFS]] Tools RPM

- [[openafs-tools-cmd.README]]: [[OpenAFS]] Tools README

Above is the RPM and the README that goes along with it. Please feel free to give them a try, and let me know if you have any questions.

The tools now include support for [[KerberosVMIT]]. If you have an existing [[KerberosVMIT]] realm with the same name as the cell you are creating, you can use these tools to integrate them. Check out [[KerberosAFSInstall]] and the README below for details

- [[K5_README]]: Kerberos 5 support README
