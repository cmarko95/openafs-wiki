Reboot the machine and log in again as the local superuser root.

       # cd /

       # shutdown -r now

       login: root
       Password: root_password

Run the AFS initialization script.

       # /etc/rc.d/init.d/afs  start

[[Confirm Cache Manager Initialization|ConfirmCacheManagerInitialization]]

## <a name="Automatically Start AFS on Syste"></a> Automatically Start AFS on System Boot

Now that you have confirmed that the AFS initialization script works correctly, take the action necessary to have it run automatically at each reboot.

Issue the chkconfig command to activate the afs configuration variable. Based on the instruction in the AFS initialization file that begins with the string #chkconfig, the command automatically creates the symbolic links that incorporate the script into the Linux startup and shutdown sequence.

       # /sbin/chkconfig  --add afs

(Optional) There are now copies of the AFS initialization file in both the /usr/vice/etc and /etc/rc.d/init.d directories, and copies of the afsd options file in both the /usr/vice/etc and /etc/sysconfig directories. If you want to avoid potential confusion by guaranteeing that the two copies of each file are always the same, create a link between them. You can always retrieve the original script or options file from the AFS CD-ROM if necessary.

       # cd /usr/vice/etc

       # rm afs.rc afs.conf

       # ln -s  /etc/rc.d/init.d/afs  afs.rc

       # ln -s  /etc/sysconfig/afs  afs.conf
