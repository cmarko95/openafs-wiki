## <a name="TWiki Variables Quickstart"></a> TWiki Variables Quickstart

TWiki Variables are names enclosed in percent signs that are that are expanded to some other text when the topic is displayed. For example, `%TOPIC%` is expanded to %TOPIC%. Some variables can take arguments in curly braces - for example, `%INCLUDE{"OtherTopic" ARG="arg"}%`.

Many TWiki variables are built-in, and others are predefined for your convenience. You can also define your own TWiki Variables at the entire site, individual web, or individual topic level. For more information, go to **[[TWikiVariables]]**

TWiki Variables are fully expanded _before_ any of the TWiki text formatting rules are applied.

**Documentation Graphics:** There are many graphics available to use in your topics. Use `%ICON{"help"}%`, `%ICON{"tip"}%`, and `%ICON{"warning"}%` to get: %H%, %T%, and %X%, respectively. [[TWikiDocGraphics]] lists them all.
