- TWiki has a very simple **[[text formatting shorthand|Main/TWikiShorthand]]**. In any case, you won't go wrong if you simply:
  - start each line without spaces
  - separate paragraphs with a blank line

- Run together capitalized words to form **[[WikiWords]]:**
  - [[WikiWords]] automatically appear as hyperlinks
  - make up meaningful, reasonably brief Wiki names - it can be a challenge (it'll sharpen you up!)
  - [[WikiWords]] has name-creation tips that may help

- If a **discussion** is going on:
  - separate each follow-up with a space
  - add your [[WikiName]] and the date at the end. Example:%BR% `-- Main.admin - 29 Jun 2010`
  - OR, by all means, insert your comment where it seems to fit best:
    - you may want to inset it with a bullet and/or _set it in italics_ so it's clear (always sign and date)
  - if you'd like to use an initial, use a link with label. Example:%BR% `-- [[Main.admin][ZXQ]] - 29 Jun 2010`

- A good format for a **new topic** is "dissertation followed by discussion":
  - start with a brief, factual introduction, followed by double horizontal rules
  - let the discussion begin

- When a discussion dies down and the page becomes static, if you're clear on your course, feel free to **refactor mercilessly**:
  - fearlessly edit down to capture the key points
  - reduce the noise without losing the facts or the flavor
  - if you merge or delete comments, group credit `Contributors:` at the end of the page
  - _This is how Wiki content matures and grows in value over time._

- For **external site links**, you can type URLs directly into the text - `http://etcete.ra/...` - it'll be clear to anyone where they're headed on click.

- TWiki is intended for world-wide use, and an internationally understood date format like <code>**01 Sep 2010**</code> or <code>**2010-09-01**</code> is preferred. It's clearer than the xx/xx/xx format, where a date like 9/1/01 can mean either Jan or Sep, depending on the local conventions of the readers. For months, use the first three letters: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr,...

- **TIP:** Check the source when you want to find out how something is formatted: click <code>**Edit**</code> on the lower toolbar. To see earlier versions, click <code>**More**</code>, then check <code>**Raw text format**</code> and click <code>**View revision**</code>. A bit of HTML experience can't hurt, but you'll soon see with [[TWikiShorthand]] how far that is from necessary.
