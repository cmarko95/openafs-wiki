What does the "T" in TWiki stand for?

## <a name="Answer:"></a> Answer:

TWiki is short for TakeFive Wiki, the name of the company where its founder [[Peter Thoeny|TWiki:Main/PeterThoeny]] worked. Peter first named the platform [[T5Wiki]], then shortened it to TWiki (pronounced _twee-kee_).

It was later discovered that Twiki is also the name of an AI robot that co-starred in the [Buck Rogers](http://www.buck-rogers.com/) movie and TV series from 1979.
