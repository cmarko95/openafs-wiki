# <a name="Linking to a file attachment"></a> Linking to a file attachment

One can create a link to a file attachment using one of the following [[TWikiVariables]], `%ATTACHURL%` or `%PUBURL%`.

`%ATTACHURL%` is the full URL for attachments in the current topic. For example:

`%ATTACHURL%/image.gif`

To link to a file attachment in another topic, use the `%PUBURL%` variable. For example:

`%PUBURL%/%WEB%/OtherTopic/image.gif`
