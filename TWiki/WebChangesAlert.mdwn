## <a name="Web Changes Notification Service"></a> Web Changes Notification Service

Each %WIKITOOLNAME% web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert.

- You can subscribe and unsubscribe yourself in [[WebNotify]] on each web. Changes are immediate.

- The frequency of alerts is set by the TWiki site administrator: it could be once a day, every hour, whatever works for the particular web.
  - On TWiki.org, alerts are sent once a day.

See [[TWikiSiteTools]] for information on how to setup the alerts.
