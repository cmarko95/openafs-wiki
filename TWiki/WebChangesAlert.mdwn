## <a name="Web Changes Notification Service"></a> Web Changes Notification Service

Each TWiki web has an automatic email notification service that sends you an email with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert.

### <a name="Subscription"></a> Subscription

You can subscribe and unsubscribe yourself in [[WebNotify]] on each web. Please keep the list in alphabetical order so that names can be found easily.

**_Format:_** TWiki handles entries in bullet list (`<space><space><space>*`) format containing the [[WikiName]] of a user; a WikiName with e-mail address; or a [[TWikiGroup|Main/TWikiGroups]]. Examples:

- `Main.FredBloggs`
- `Main.FredBloggs - secondary@home.com`
- `Main.EngineeringGroup`

The first entry is the default form, the notification gets sent to the e-mail address specified in the user's home page. The second entry lists an alternative e-mail address. The third entry specifies a group, the notification gets sent to each member of the group.

### <a name="E-mail Alerts"></a> E-mail Alerts

The frequency of alerts is set by the TWiki site administrator: It could be once a day, every hour, whatever works for the particular web. On TWiki.org, alerts are sent once a day.

See [[TWikiSiteTools]] for information on how to setup the alerts.
