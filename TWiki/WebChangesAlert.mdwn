### <a name="Web Changes Notification Service"></a> Web Changes Notification Service

Each TWiki web has an automatic e-mail notification service that sends you an e-mail with links to all of the topics modified since the last alert.

**_Note for System Administrators:_** Notification is supported by an add-on to the TWiki kernel called the MailerContrib. See the [[MailerContrib]] topic for details of how to set up this service.

**_Note:_** If you prefer a news feed, point your reader to %INCLUDINGWEB%.WebRss (for RSS 1.0 feeds) or %INCLUDINGWEB%.WebAtom (for ATOM 1.0 feeds). Learn more at %SYSTEMWEB%.WebRssBase and %SYSTEMWEB%.WebAtomBase, respectively.
