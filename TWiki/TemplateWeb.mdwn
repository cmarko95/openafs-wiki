## <a name="Purpose"></a> Purpose

Template webs were created to act as templates in creating webs. It is now possible to creation webs via the [[ManagingWebs]] topic. In the not so distant past TWiki webs were created by hand. The data directory contains the different webs such as **Main** and **TWiki**. A web that begins with an underscore "\_" character is considered invisible and a template. All files in the **\_default** (or any other web that begins with an underscore) template web will be copied into your new web. The **\_default** web template contains the following topics: `WebChanges, WebHome, WebIndex, WebNotify, WebPreferences, WebSearch, WebStatistics and WebTopicList.`

## <a name="Customizing"></a> Customizing

The web template is useful for administrators to design for creating webs of a certain type. Departmental webs can at least begin with a similar look and feel.

Simply create a web with an underscore for the first character. These can be used by authorized users to create webs from this template.
