### <a name="LANGUAGE -- current user&#39;s langu"></a> LANGUAGE -- current user's language

- Returns the language code for the language used as the current user. This is the language actually used by TWiki Internationalization (e.g. in user interface).
- The language is detected from the user's browser, unless some site/web/user/session-defined setting overrides it:
  - If the `LANGUAGE` preference is set, it's used as user's language instead of any language detected from the browser.
  - Avoid defining `LANGUAGE` at a non per-user way, so each user can choose his/her preferred language.
