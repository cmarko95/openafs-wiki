# <a name="Bulk Registration"></a> Bulk Registration

Administrators can use this topic to register (i.e. create logins and [[UserTopics]]) for a group of people quickly. Create a table in the REGISTERTOPIC named below, setting each row to represent each user and each column to correspond to the metadata. Then press the button on this page to perform registration for those users. Unlike normal registration the administrator is assumed to have correct e-mail addresses for the users, so no verification is required. Note that the new users are not notified that they have an account. This is so you can prepare and verify the accounts before announcing them. To announce them use the [[BulkResetPassword]] feature: this will assign a new random password and notify users.

Any fields you define in this table will end up in the User's topic. If a form (such as [[UserForm]]) is attached to [[NewUserTemplate]] then the data will go in as META:FIELDS, meaning that you can use SEARCH formfield constructs to search.

If you use the [[UserForm]] then ensure that it contains all the fields you define here. Otherwise they will disappear when the user edits their home topic!

- Define where to pick up the table of users to register
  - Set REGISTERTOPIC = [[UnprocessedRegistrations]]
- Use this to define where to log the bulk registration process. It needs to be a topic name in this web.
  - Set LOGTOPIC = %REGISTERTOPIC%Log
- Set this to 1 to make the bulk registration overwrite any existing user topics. By default, existing user topics are left alone.
  - Set OVERWRITEHOMETOPICS = 0

### <a name="Example format"></a> Example format

The following should be inserted into your REGISTERTOPIC as a table.

    | FirstName | LastName | Email | WikiName | CustomFieldThis | SomeOtherRandomField | WhateverYouLike |
    | Test | User | you@example.com | TestUser | A | B | C |

To use this:

1. Make sure that the Custom fields appear on the [[UserForm]]
2. Copy the above table to your clipboard
3. Click through and paste this on %REGISTERTOPIC%, save the topic and return here.
4. Click the Bulk register button below
5. Read %LOGTOPIC%
6. When you are ready, use the [[BulkResetPassword]] page to assign passwords and notify the users of their new accounts.

Notes:

1. The first row of the table dictates the heading format and that the fieldnames must be plain, i.e. **must not contain bolded** entries.
2. You are responsible for ensuring that the fieldnames appear in the [[TWiki.UserForm|TWiki/UserForm]]
3. Only administrators can run this.
