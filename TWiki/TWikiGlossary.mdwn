# <a name="TWiki Glossary"></a> TWiki Glossary

TWiki uses a handful of general computer and Internet terms in a TWiki-specific way. This _could_ get confusing, but it actually works out fine in use. The TWikiGlossary is also a quick way to get familiar with the overall TWiki set-up...

**_(Under...construction: this is a rough draft)_**

**Attachment** _aka_ **File Attachment** - upload files by browser and attach them to any page, where they can be viewed, edited, downloaded; accessed by clicking **Attach** at page bottom ([[FileAttachments]])

**Plugin** - a TWiki feature add-on; a Perl module that enhances TWiki, through the Plugin API spec; named `<_>Plugin.pm`, ex: `SomePlugin.pm` ([[TWikiPlugins|Main/TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Plugins]])

**Plugin API** - specs for building TWiki Plugins with Perl modules ([[TWikiPlugins|Main/TWikiDocumentation#TWiki_Plugins]])

**Preference** - a customizable TWiki parameter; settings site-wide, by the web, by the topic on [[TWikiPreferences]] and [[WebPreferences]] pages, also on Plugins, user and regular topic pages.

**site** - a TWiki installation consisting of one or more TWiki _[[webs|Main/WebHome#TWikiWeb]]_

<a name="TWikiTopic"></a> **topic** _aka_ **WikiTopic** - a single TWiki page, it has a [[WikiName]] that's unique within its home _[[web|Main/WebHome#TWikiWeb]]_

**TWiki** - based on "Wiki", from the original WikiWikiWeb, first OF this style of edit-anything-anywhere Web environment; by chance, also the name of a robot (as in, the robo-head in the TWiki logo) in the old _Buck Rogers_ TV series ([[TWikiSite]])

**TWiki.org (twiki.org)** - official home site, center of all development, housed on SourceForge.com

**variable** - text-strings of the form `%VARIABLE%` that are expanded on the fly into text, image, or any other type of embedded content; predefined variables are coded into the main TWiki package, Plugins variables, and user-specified variables are created in [[TWikiPreferences]], [[WebPreferences]], or single topics

<a name="TWikiWeb"></a> **web** - with a small "w", as opposed to the Web, World Wide; a collection of TWiki topics under a common name; topics share Preference settings, disk file structure, and are handled as a group by search

**WikiTopic** - _see: [[topic|Main/WebHome#TWikiTopic]]_
