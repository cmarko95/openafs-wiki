## <a name="TWiki is a Web-based collaborati"></a> TWiki is a Web-based collaboration platform

- A TWiki site is an easy-to-use, full-featured open communications environment:
  - people anywhere on the Web or on an intranet can meet
  - rich Web text, images, and online multimedia are easily shared
  - documents and other files can be uploaded and downloaded
  - all you need is a Web browser and any available network connection

## <a name="TWiki is an UNUSUAL Web-based co"></a> TWiki is an UNUSUAL Web-based collaboration platform

- There's no doubt that, to most people, TWiki at first seems almost the opposite of how the Web and online communications "normally" work. Why?
  - TWiki operates like a whiteboard for the Web - it lets you and all other users write, place pictures and post links, anywhere on any page.
  - Not only that, everyone can EDIT anything, anywhere on a page.
  - At first, this may seem "too" open - it soon becomes second-nature, allowing you the freedom to edit and update the way you want to.

## <a name="TWiki is a powerful Web enhancem"></a> TWiki is a powerful Web enhancement...

- TWiki's parsing engine is written in Perl. It reads a text file, and converts TWiki shorthand into standard HTML, on the fly. The point is to:
  - make adding and editing text simple _(How simple? Click on the **Edit** link at the bottom of the page...)_
  - let you find information _fast_ ([[WebSearch]])

- TWiki provides an intuitive way for people to meet and collaborate, that aspires to the Zen ideals known as [[WabiSabi]]. It finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral and constantly evolving. (When it comes down to it, that's all you need.)

- TWiki is one of many [[WikiWikiClones]], based on Ward Cunningham's original [Wiki Wiki Web](http://c2.com/).

## <a name="&quot;TWiki&quot; stands for..."></a> "TWiki" stands for...

- _Wiki wiki_ means "quick" in Hawaiian. The shuttle at Honolulu Airport is called the _wiki wiki_ bus, which is where the original Wiki web got its name.
- _TWiki_ is short for _TakeFive Wiki_, the name of the company where its founder Peter Thoeny worked. (It was later discovered that _Twiki_ is also the name of an AI robot that co-starred in the [_Buck Rogers_](http://www.buck-rogers.com/) movie and TV series from 1979.)
