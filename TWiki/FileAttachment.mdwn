The latest version of FileAttachments includes attachments under revision control. It's in the 01 Sep 2001 TWiki release.

- Current Dev topic: [[AttachmentsUnderRevisionControl]]

----

Each topic can have files attached to it. This is similar to an e-mail attachment. Just use your browser to upload or download a file.

- To upload: Click on the Attach link at the bottom of each page. A form is shown where you can browse for a file and upload it. The uploaded file will show up in the FileAttachment table.
- To download: Click on the file in the FileAttachment table.

**FileAttachment table**

Is a table that looks like this:

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4">
  <tr bgcolor="#99CCCC">
    <th>FileAttachment: </th>
    <th> Action: </th>
    <th> Size: </th>
    <th> Date: </th>
    <th> Who: </th>
    <th> Comment: </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> (attached file) </td>
    <td> (view, update, add) </td>
    <td> (file size) </td>
    <td> (upload date) </td>
    <td> (uploaded by) </td>
    <td> (file comment) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Action** is:

- **view:** View file. This is the same as clicking on the filename.
- **update:** Update file that is already attached.
- **add:** Add a new attachment.

**Remarks**

- Once a file is attached it can be referenced in the topic by `%ATTACHURL%/{filename}` . Example:
  - Attach file: `Sample.txt`
  - Text is shown as: <http://www.dementia.org/twiki//view/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/Sample.txt> , i.e. it is a link.
- GIF and JPG images can be attached and shown in the text like this:
  - Attach file: `Smile.gif`
  - Edit topic and write text: `%ATTACHURL%/Smile.gif`
  - Text is shown as: ![Smile.gif](http://www.dementia.org/twiki//view/%WEB%/%TOPIC%/Smile.gif) , i.e. it shows up as an image.
- It is not possible to delete attached files with the current TWiki implementation. Contact if you need to delete files.
