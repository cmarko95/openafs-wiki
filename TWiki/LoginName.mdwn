A login name is a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores.

You cannot alter your LoginName: you have to get the administrator to do this for you.

Look in [[TWikiUsers]] - if your name is followed by a dash and a word, usually lowercase, this is what you log in with.

e.g.

- TWikiGuest - guest - 05 Sep 2004

Would mean that TWikiGuest would log in using the login name 'guest'

If, on the other hand, if your entry is like this:

- TWikiGuest - 05 Sep 2004

Then you would log in using your [[WikiName]], in this case 'TWikiGuest'
