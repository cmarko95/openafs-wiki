I've problems with the WebSearch. There is no Search Result on any inquiry. By clicking the Index topic it's the same problem.

## <a name="Answer:"></a> Answer:

That is an indication that %WIKITOOLNAME% can't find the `egrep` and `fgrep` commands on your system. Check the `{RCS}EgrepCmd}` and `{RCS}{FgrepCmd}` settings in [configure](http://www.dementia.org/twiki/configure).
