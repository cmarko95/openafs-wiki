## <a name="Welcome, Main.admin!"></a> Welcome, Main.admin!

Welcome to %WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a [[TWikiSite]] (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. %WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal Web site... except that it encourages contribution and **editing** of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

**_Mission: "TWiki is a leading-edge, web-based collaboration platform targeting the corporate intranet world. TWiki fosters information flow within an organization; lets distributed teams work together seamlessly and productively; and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content."_**

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages. It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites. TWiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.

**How TWiki Works**

1. **Browse.** This is a site like other sites. Read and follow interesting links.
  - **Web:** A [[TWikiSite]] is divided into webs, each one represents an area for collaboration. This site has the following webs:
  - **Topic:** Each web is made up of hyperlinked [[topics|Main/TWikiTopics]] that appear in your browser.
  - **WebChanges:** In each TWiki web to find what's new
2. **Write.** Speak your mind! From your browser you can change or add to anything you see in a TWiki topic. Use regular text or [[TWikiShorthand]]. To contribute:
  - **Create An Account.** To be able to edit or write new content, you'll need to create an account for yourself. It's simple, and only takes a minute. [[TWikiRegistration]] This will also create your personal home page.
  - click <code>**Edit**</code> at the bottom of any topic and make your changes
  - click <code>**[ Preview Changes ]**</code> at the bottom to verify the topic (use your brower's <code>**Back**</code> button if necessary)
  - click <code>**[ Save Changes ]**</code>
3. **Don't worry!** It can be scary at first to change "public" content. Please just try it. _Revision control_ keeps all content, nothing is lost. For special cases, [[access control|Main/TWikiAccessControl]] is available yet you may find you don't need it in most cases. You'll soon see how successful [[WikiCulture]] works in this kind of collaboration environment. This is new. Just try to relax.
4. **Experiment.** Edit your personal page or visit the [[Sandbox|Sandbox/WebHome]] web.
  1. **Link.** To link to another topic, start by editing an existing topic.
    - To create a link to an existing topic type its <code>**JoinCapitalizedWords**</code> name. [[WikiWords]] (two or more capitalized words run together) link automatically.
  2. **Create a new topic.** To create a new topic, start by editing an existing topic.
    - In an existing topic, create a link to a new topic, entering a newly <code>**UsedPhrase**</code> as a WikiWord.
    - After saving the existing topic you will see a question mark link "<u>?</u>" behind the WikiWord.
    - Click on the question mark to create the new topic.
  3. **Topic history.** Click <code>**History**</code> at the bottom of a topic
  4. **Attach files.** Click <code>**Attach**</code> to upload and attach any type of file.
5. **Organize.** You can learn to use [[TWikiForms]] and [[FormattedSearch]]es to include topic information - for example, classify pages by subject, status, or date.
6. **Learn more.** [[TWikiTutorial]] is a 20-minute tour of TWiki essentials. [[ATasteOfTWiki]] is a short introduction training course for beginners. [[WikiReferences]] links to selected articles and books about wiki technology and online collaboration.
