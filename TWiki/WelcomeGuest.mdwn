Welcome to %WIKITOOLNAME%! This is a [[TWikiSite]] (pronounced _twee-kee site_), a meeting place to work on common interests. Anyone can contribute using any web browser. %WIKITOOLNAME% looks like a normal web site... except that it encourages contribution and **editing** of pages, questions, answers, comments and updates.

"Wiki" systems are fundamentally editable web pages. It's a fun and useful way of communicating asynchronously over the web for many existing intranet and public Internet sites. TWiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web.
