# <a name="Preference settings"></a> Preference settings

TWiki has four levels of preferences settings:

1. Site-level settings: [[TWikiPreferences]]
  - Site name, proxy settings, access control, skin
2. Web-level settings: located in each Web, e.g. [[WebPreferences]] topic
  - Web specific access control, navigation links, colors
3. User-level settings: In each user's home page, e.g. Main.admin topic
  - Settings that are only in effect when this user is logged in, such as LINKTOOLTIPINFO
4. Topic-level settings: Affecting current topic, for web applications

Preferences can be overridden by the next level down.
