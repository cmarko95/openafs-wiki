# <a name="Re-parenting a topic"></a> Re-parenting a topic

The breadcrumb displayed with a particular TWiki topic is constructed with a topic's **Parent**. On the footer to each page there is a link called **More**. Within this page there is a topic action that will allow you to select a new parent for the page.

To re-parent a page:

1. Select a new topic from the list of topics to be the topic's parent
2. Click on the **Edit** button below the list of topics
3. Click on the **Save** button

You will notice that the breadcrumb will now reflect the new parent.
