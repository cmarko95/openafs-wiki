## <a name="Removing User Accounts"></a> Removing User Accounts

To remove a user account (FredQuimby, who logs in as "fred"):

1. If you are using a `.htpasswd` file, edit the `.htpasswd` file to delete the line starting `fred:`
  - **Warning:** Do **not** use the Apache `htpasswd` program with `.htpasswd` files generated by TWiki! `htpasswd` wipes out email addresses that TWiki plants in the info fields of this file.
2. Remove the `FredQuimby - fred` line from the Main.TWikiUsers topic
3. Remove `FredQuimby` from all groups and from all the `ALLOWWEB/ALLOWTOPIC...` declarations, if any.%BR% **_Note:_** If you fail to do this you risk creating a security hole, as the next user to register with the wikiname FredQuimby will inherit the old FredQuimby's permissions.
4. _[optional]_ Delete their user topic Main.FredQuimby.

**_Note:_** Consider leaving the user topic file in place so their past signatures and revision author entries don't end up looking like [[AnUncreatedTopic]]. If you want to make it clear the user is no longer with the organization or has been banished, replace the topic content with a note to that effect. The existance of the UserName topic should also prevent that user name from being re-used, sealing the potential security hole regarding inherited permissions..
