%X% Some of the features below may be disabled, depending on your TWiki configuration.

## <a name="Authentication and Access Contro"></a> Authentication and Access Control

- [[TWikiUserAuthentication]] describes your options for user authentication
- [[TWikiAccessControl]] describes how to define groups and how to restrict access to content

## <a name="Register User"></a> Register User

You don't have to have user home pages in TWiki for Authentication to work - see [[TWikiUserAuthentication]] for details.

- [[TWikiRegistration]] is used when you want new users to individually register with TWiki by filling out a form
- You can create a custom versions of [[NewUserTemplate]] and [[UserForm]]
- [[BulkRegistration]] is used by administrators to register multiple users at the same time

## <a name="Change, Reset and Install Passwo"></a> Change, Reset and Install Passwords

_Note that the below features are only relevant when you use an internal password manager where TWiki can set and reset passwords._

- [[ChangePassword]] is for users who _can_ remember their password and want to change it
- [[ResetPassword]] is for users who _cannot_ remember their password; a system generated password is e-mailed to them
- [[BulkResetPassword]] if for administrators who want to reset many passwords at once
- [[ChangeEmailAddress]] changes the hidden email address stored in the password file

## <a name="Changing User Account Names"></a> Changing User Account Names

To change the user's [[WikiName]]:

- Rename the user's TWiki homepage in the Main web, such as from `JaneSmith` to `JaneMiller`.
  - Fix backlinks in the Main web only
  - Make sure the group topics are updated (if any.)
- Edit the [[Main.TWikiUsers|Main/TWikiUsers]] topic and move the user's entry so that the list is in proper alphabetical order.
- Recreate the old topic with a pointer to the new topic, so that links in other webs work properly. Example content:%BR% `%M% Jane Smith is now known as JaneMiller`

If external authentication is used and you want to change the login name:

- The login name needs to be changed in the authentication server (e.g. Active Directory)
- In TWiki's [[Main.TWikiUsers|Main/TWikiUsers]] topic, fix the mapping from login name to [[WikiName]]:%BR% `   * JaneSmith - jsmith - 13 Sep 2006` %BR% to: %BR% `   * JaneMiller - jmiller - 13 Sep 2006`

## <a name="Removing User Accounts"></a> Removing User Accounts

To remove a user account (FredQuimby, who logs in as "fred"):

1. If you are using a `.htpasswd` file, edit the `.htpasswd` file to delete the line starting `fred:`
  - **Warning:** Do **not** use the Apache `htpasswd` program with `.htpasswd` files generated by TWiki! `htpasswd` wipes out email addresses that TWiki plants in the info fields of this file.
2. Remove the `FredQuimby - fred` line from the Main.TWikiUsers topic
3. Remove `FredQuimby` from all groups and from all the `ALLOWWEB/ALLOWTOPIC...` declarations, if any.%BR% **_Note:_** If you fail to do this you risk creating a security hole, as the next user to register with the wikiname FredQuimby will inherit the old FredQuimby's permissions.
4. _[optional]_ Delete their user topic Main.FredQuimby (including attachments, if any.)

**_Note:_** Consider leaving the user topic file in place so their past signatures and revision author entries don't end up looking like [[AnUncreatedTopic]]. If you want to make it clear the user is no longer around, replace the topic content with a note to that effect. The existance of the UserName topic should also prevent that user name from being re-used, sealing the potential security hole regarding inherited permissions..
