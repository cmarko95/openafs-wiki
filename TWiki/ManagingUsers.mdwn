# <a name="Manage Users"></a> Manage Users

_Register users on your TWiki site; change/reset/install passwords; remove user accounts_

## <a name="Authentication and Access Contro"></a> Authentication and Access Control

- [[TWikiUserAuthentication]] describes options of user authentication
- [[TWikiAccessControl]] describes how to define groups and how to restrict access to content

## <a name="Register User"></a> Register User

- [[TWikiRegistration]] is for users to fill out a form
- [[NewUserTemplate]] can be changed to customize user home pages

## <a name="Change, Reset and Install Passwo"></a> Change, Reset and Install Passwords

- [[ChangePassword]] is for users who remember their password
- [[ResetPassword]] is for users who do _not_ remember their password; they are asked to send a request to the site administrator to install a new password
- [[InstallPassword]] is for the site administrator to install a password

## <a name="Removing User Accounts"></a> Removing User Accounts

To remove a user account:

1. Edit the `data/.htpasswd` file to delete their entry (only applies if you are using a .htpasswd file)
2. Remove the `FredQuimby` line from the Main.TWikiUsers topic
3. Remove user from all groups and from all the `ALLOWWEB/ALLOWTOPIC...` declarations, if any.%BR% **_Note:_** Otherwise this is a security hole as the first one to re-register with this name will be granted the permissions of the previous user.
4. _[optional]_ Remove their topic files: `data/Main/FredQuimby.txt` and `data/Main/FredQuimby.txt,v`

**_Note:_** Consider leaving the user topic file in place so their past signatures and revision author entries don't end up looking like [[AnUncreatedTopic]]. If you want to make it clear the user is inactive on your site (e.g. [[PeterThoeny]]) or has been banished add a note to that effect and write protect the page ([[TWikiAccessControl]]). The existance of the UserName topic prevent that user name from being re-used.
