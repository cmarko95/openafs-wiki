# <a name="Change E-mail Address"></a> Change E-mail Address

[[TWikiUsers]] has a full list of user names.

This form is used to change your registered e-mail addresses. Your registered e-mails are used by TWiki for sending you e-mails, include notifications of password changes. The addresses you register via this form are kept secret and will **not** be published anywhere on this site.

%X% **_Security Note_**: You really ought to register a valid e-mail address. If TWiki can't find a registered e-mail for you in the secret database, it will look in your user topic for a line like this:

       * Set Email = user@example.com

If your user topic is not protected from changes by other people, and you don't register an e-mail address using this form, then your user account could be hijacked by someone else.

If your old e-mail addresses are all invalid (you can't receive mail there any more) and you have forgotten your password, please contact .

Registered e-mail addresses for currently logged in user (`admin`):
