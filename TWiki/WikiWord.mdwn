A WikiWord consists of two or more words with initial capitals, run together.

When you type a WikiWord, you establish a hyperlink. It's as easy as that.

WikiWords are styled like this because:

- It makes Wiki hyperlinks instantly recognizable
- It leads to interesting Wiki topics
- It avoids the need to fiddle with HTML tags
- It avoids over-general topics because at least two words are required

**Syntax of a WikiWord**

- Uppercase letter(s)
- Lowercase letter(s)
- Uppercase letter(s)
- Optional lowercase or uppercase letter(s) or number(s)

**Good examples for WikiWords:**

- [[WikiWord]]
- [[GoodStyle]]
- [[AVeryLongWikiTopicNameIsAlsoPossible]]: wherever an uppercase or lowercase letter is allowed, a group of letters of the same case is allowed
- [[YearTwoThousand]]

**Bad examples for WikiWords:**

- Web: Name without the uppercase letter(s), lowercase letter(s), uppercase letter(s) sequence
- [[T5Wiki]]: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence
- [[Md5sumsAfterBurning]]: Name with number before the uppercase, lowercase, uppercase sequence
- Know-How: Name with dashes in between

**Hints**

- Insert WikiWords wherever you can. Rich linking helps to make a Wiki successful.
- Be specific. All topics in a web share one name space. For example, instead of `FunctionalSpec` write `BreadSlicerFunctionalSpec` because other projects might also have a functional spec topic.
- %H% To stop a WikiWord from being turned into a hyperlink, insert the text `<nop>` immediately before the WikiWord.
- It is recommended to create topics with singular names. Plural WikiWords are automatically linked to the singular topic, i.e. the link [[WikiWords]] links to the topic [[WikiWord]].
- Sometimes you have to be creative to find a good WikiName. Examples:
  - To create a topic about the the **Bread Slicer 1.2** product, use `BreadSlicer1dot2` or `BreadSlicer1pt2`, but not `BreadSlicer1.2`.
  - To create a topic about **year 2000**, you could go for `YearTwoK` or `YearTwoThousand`, but not `Year2K` or `Y2K` or `Y2000`.
- Turn acronyms into WikiWords, i.e. take `FaqIndex` for a "FAQ index" topic.
- You can specify any link label by using double square brackets, e.g. write `[[TWikiAccessControl][access control]]` to get a link to [[TWikiAccessControl]] that looks like [[access control|Main/TWikiAccessControl]].
- %X% The topic is assumed to be in the current TWiki web. Prepending the name of a TWiki web and a period links to a topic in another web.
