## <a name="Using HTML"></a> Using HTML

You can use just about any HTML tag without a problem. You can add HTML if there is no TWiki equivalent, for example, write `<strike>deleted text</strike>` to get <strike>deleted text</strike>.

%X% There are a few usability and technical considerations to keep in mind:

- On collaboration pages, it's better **not** to use HTML, but to use [[TWiki shorthand|Main/WebHome#TWikiShorthand]] instead - this keeps the text uncluttered and easy to edit.
- If you use HTML use [XHTML 1.0 Transitional](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) syntax.
- %X% Script tags may be filtered out, at the discretion of your TWiki administrator.

Recommendations when pasting HTML from other sources:

- Copy only text between `<body>` and `</body>` tags.
- Remove all empty lines. TWiki inserts `<p />` paragraph tags on empty lines, which causes problems if done between HTML tags that do not allow paragraph tags, like for example between table tags.
- Remove leading spaces. TWiki might interpret some text as lists.
- Do not span a tag over more than one line. TWiki requires that the opening and closing angle brackets - <code>**&lt;...&gt;**</code> - of an HTML tag are on the same line, or the tag will be broken.
- In your HTML editing program, save without hard line breaks on text wrap.

%T% TWiki converts shorthand notation to HTML for display. To copy a fully marked-up page, simply view the source in your browser and save the contents. If you need to save HTML frequently, you may want to check out TWiki:Plugins/PublishAddOn.
