# <a name="Wiki name"></a> Wiki name

Your name, usually your first and last name connected without a space.

For example, Tim Berners-Lee's WikiName is [[TimBernersLee]].

%X% Your name is also a potentially valid [[WikiWord]] when used within a topic. However the home pages of registered users on this site are stored in the **Main** web. When you sign your username in a topic, prefix it with `Main.` (including the dot). That is, write <code>**Main.admin**</code> to link to Main.admin, your personal home page in the Main web. For convenience, your signature is also provided for copying and pasting when editing a topic.

%Y% Though rarely used in common practice, you can use the special <code>**%MAINWEB%**</code> [[variable|Main/TWikiVariables]] prefix for user names, for example, <code>**%MAINWEB%.admin**</code>.
