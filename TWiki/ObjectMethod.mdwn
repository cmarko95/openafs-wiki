An [[ObjectMethod]] is a method that must be called relative to a previous constructed object of the class type. For example:

# <a name="package Telecoms"></a> package Telecoms

## <a name="ClassMethod new()"></a> [[ClassMethod]] new()

## <a name="ObjectMethod phone( $who )"></a> [[ObjectMethod]] phone( $who )

must be called something like this

    my $mobile = new Telecoms();
    $mobile->phone( "home" );

or you can pass the object in as a parameter if you need to:

    Telecoms::phone( $mobile, "home" );
