A [[ClassMethod]] is a method that must be called relative to the containing class object. This normally only applies to the `new` method used to create new object instances. For example,

# <a name="package Telecoms"></a> package Telecoms

## <a name="ClassMethod new()"></a> [[ClassMethod]] new()

    my $mobile = new Telecoms();

or

    my $mobile = Telecoms->new();
